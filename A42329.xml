            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:55301:3"/> while he lived, and since he died, his poor Servants hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly crave leave to bring their Teares, and contribute what they may to the Glory of his Memory; It may offend your Enemies, it cannot Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, to whom he was an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as well as faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. We had the Happiness to behold the several motions of Divine Providence, and how wonderfully those various Changes were guided for your Restauration, &amp; how strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>God</hi> did extend the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of some men in that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, beyond all their Abilities natural and acquired, to their
<pb facs="tcp:55301:3"/> own Admiration, so that all are forced to confess, That Your Majesty is the gift of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to these Nations, and Your Restauration from <hi>God</hi> Himself, who hath filled your Royal Heart with great Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness and Affections to all your People, even to those that have been your greatest Enemies: It must certainly in some measure attract an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance and Duty from them to Your Majesty. I have followed in this Discourse, the direction which King <hi>JAMES,</hi> of glorious Memory, gave to Archbishop <hi>Spotswood,</hi> who objected the difficulty of some
<pb facs="tcp:55301:4"/> of the later parts of the <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> History, which he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to write, that he should keep to the Truth, and make that his only Guide.</p>
            <p>This Subject required a better Head, and a more Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Pen than mine, which is too mean and dull for such <hi>Triumphs</hi> and <hi>Glories;</hi> but what is wanting in Skill, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced by an Affection Loyal and Intire. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and loyal <hi>Cold Stream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> that served the General with Faithfulness and gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, have no other Patron up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth but Your Majesty, and those that are Your

I do therefore in all Humility, Implore your Majesties Favour and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection to them all, and to my Self, who am the unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of their number; humbly craving Pardon for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of this Address of</p>

<pb facs="tcp:55301:6"/> to your Study and Imitation. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, I deserve blame for putting forth this History without those Ornaments that so glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a Subject requires. Therefore I intreat your Grace, to write it in a new and better Edition, and transcribe his Actions into your Life and Practice; that will be a most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent way to preserve his Memory. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less you are under the greatest Obligations to Vertue and Honour, to maintain the Glory and Renown of your Predecessor: <hi>Alexander</hi> would not let a Coward be call'd by his Name; And the People of <hi>Rome</hi> would not suffer a Son of <hi>Scipio Affricanus</hi> the elder to wear the Pourtrature of his Father in a Ring, because he degenerated from his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
            <p>God hath blessed you with great Talents, Riches, Honour, good Parts, and Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Mind; I hope you will improve all these for the Interest of Vertue and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

               <hi>Themistocles</hi> kill'd a <hi>Graecian</hi> for being an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter to the <hi>Persians,</hi> and imployed the <hi>Greek</hi> Language <hi>in usum Barbarorum,</hi> for the use of <hi>Barbarians,</hi> (thus this proud Nation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted all others.) God forbid that you should abuse the Gifts of God unto Barbarous uses, and disgrace your Father (who was a Person of great Vertues) by any kind of Vice whatsoever. I have reason to believe, and
<pb facs="tcp:55301:6"/> hope better of your Grace, whom I have known almost from the first year of your Age, and do perswade my self, that you will confute that false saying, <hi>[Filii Heroum sunt Noxae,]</hi> by your Pactice and Vertuous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation. The great Advantages that you have to do good, by your Example and Encouragement, do make me use the more Liberty; And your Grace cannot but remember, I alwayes took the same Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome with your Father, whom I loved sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, and served long within the Sphaere of my Calling, and beyond it. The faithfullest Counsel that I humbly propose to your Grace, is to follow his Example, and love those whom he loved; they will not be Friends only to your Fortune and Prosperity, but to your Self upon all occasions: And no man is so great that need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not Friends, nay the greatest most need them: God make you highly serviceable to Himself, useful to your King and Country, and preserve you from the Errours and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of your younger years, which shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be the Prayer of him who doth not forget his Duty to the Dead as well as the Living; And will ever, my Lord, be</p>

            <head>THE <hi>PREFACE.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THis <hi>Relator</hi> is one of those that loves to maintain good Customes, and thinks this one, that the <hi>Reader</hi> ought to be saluted with a <hi>Preface,</hi> whom he assures, That he hath very great and obliging Reasons, to give a true Accompt of this Subject, and keep up the Memory as far as he may of the honest <hi>Cold Streamers.</hi> It was written at the request of some Friends, and in some hast; For Relations of matter of Fact do not require much study, especially where <hi>Truth</hi> is only (and not <hi>Ornament</hi>) endeavoured, to the last of which this Author doth not pretend. Being bound by many Obligations to see the General in his Grave, and to do his last Duty in that Vacation, between his Death and Funeral, he did this Service to his Memory, &amp; entertained his Sorrows with this diversion, to remember his brave Actions, and let the World see that this great General had lived to good purpose. It might have been made publique before his Body was in the Grave, but for some mens prejudices and mistakes. The Relator will be very glad that it may hereafter be done by an able Pen, so it be with Truth and Modesty, and hopes he is a
<pb facs="tcp:55301:8"/> person of some little Conscience, and hath learned better than to bear witness to a Lye: Mankind is too often guilty of Mistakes, and therefore he layes down the Inferences and Remarks as doubtful, and other matters which he supposes and endeavors to prove; He does without Complement confess, That his Understanding is weak, and his Judgment Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous, but his Relation of matter of Fact is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. He hath the honour to bear the Char<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cter of a Church man, and had the Interest and Credit to be a Domestick to this great Person, and judges it a kind of Crime to let his Memory be buried in his Grave; and though insufficient for such a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, yet believes duty and affection will excuse his weakness and inability.</p>
            <p>The Relator thinks himself bound to give notice of the means and wayes by which he comes to the true Knowledge of these matters, lest any mistake all for Invention. For the first part to the latter end of the Year <hi>1656,</hi> he had it by the Dukes own Relation, in his Discourses with several of his Friends, who were Associates and Companions in those Transactions; and so this Author, who had advantage, in the time of his Solitudes and Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to be well informed, for the latter part of his Life he was an Eye and an Ear-witness of all Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations: He was not with him at Sea, by reason of a languishing Sickness, of which he is yet scarce recovered; and therein makes use of the Journal of a Principal Flag-Officer, who was a stout and experienced Seamen, and the Generals Second in
<pb facs="tcp:55301:8"/> that famous Battel that lasted four days with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> so that the <hi>Reader</hi> may see he had suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent opportunity to be well instructed for this Work; from none other had he any assistance, but opposition and censure enough to have discouraged any but a poor <hi>Cold Streamer,</hi> who can have nothing to hope, or fear; yet this Discourse had the felicity of the subject it treats of, to receive no Wounds or Gashes through all the Hands of its Opposers; Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellers may shew their Wits, when they conceal their Names, but Truth will prevail, and not hide it self in corners. The Author Resolved to write Truth or nothing, for to publish what hath flown abroad in the weekly Prints, with the fulsome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of tedious Letters and Addresses, larded with shameless and bold fac'd Untruths, is enough to Nauseat the <hi>Reader,</hi> and make him to value Ale above History.</p>
            <p>If any shall blame him, that he attributes too much to one Person, when many Hands and Tools were necessary, and imployed for so great a Work; They are to consider, that a General is Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, and must be understood Collectively; As when it is said, Alexander <hi>Conquered the World,</hi> and <hi>Caesar France;</hi> none can be so ignorant, but to conceive that they had Officers and Assistants. When this piece was upon the Forge, the Relator had in his thoughts the Scheme of a Discourse here to be annexed, to be Entituled, <hi>Observations of the true Causes of the Restauration of the</hi> English <hi>Monarchy in the most Glorious Person of our
<pb facs="tcp:55301:9"/> present Soveraign</hi> Charles <hi>the Second;</hi> Where all the Restorers should have been enumerated and reduced to their proper Heads of Causality, and the reason of their Activity, which is a Work that requires a great Brain, and one well versed in Civil Affairs, to which this Author is a stranger, both by his Profession and Obscurity; but doubtless it would tend to Publick Benefit, for the true Causes of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storation of the Monarchy duly considered and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, would be a great means of its Preservation; He mentions this, to stir up some active and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit to attempt at it; such a Discourse must be mannaged with the greatest freedome, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from all Jealousies, else it would be useless and unprofitable, for it must treat of the Ayms of all Parties that were then in Power, and who are not now asleep. How willing soever some were to suppress these Papers, none could be more than the Author, who is not so blind, but does foresee a great deal of Contradiction and heavy Censure from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and those no small Persons.</p>

               </gap>ke Terms and Conditions for their Concerns of
<pb facs="tcp:55301:9"/> Liberty, and their pretended Proprieties in the Estates of others. I would have these Persons consider, what a dangerous Attempt this must have been, and a Crime unpardonable, <hi>To make a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, a Royal Slave;</hi> If the Parliament would have made any Agreement, they might with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Controul; but it is an unjust Accusation to make that his Sin, which was his greatest Vertue: That he did not imprison Majesty in Chains and Fetters, and destroy the Duty he intended, in turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it into Disobedience and a new Rebellion. This was under long deliberation, and by all that loved him, carried in the Negative, That he should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Treat with his Master as his Equal, which was an Offence that could never have been forgotten; and he was not obliged to his own Ruine, to satisfie the needless scruples of others: I would put these men in mind of Our former Confusions, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was not their Judgment then, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was to be done for publick Peace and Safety, which if they would remember, and well consider of, they would be thankful for our present Settlement, and not provoke God further by their Murmuring and Sedition.</p>
            <p>There are very many others that are mutinous, &amp; exclaiming against his Memory, because they were disappointed of Rewards for high and eminent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and possibly some have well deserved; such a great Work needed many Wheels to make the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Chyme in Majesty at that time, but many arrogate that, to which they were not privy; I
<pb facs="tcp:55301:10"/> must confess, that he was somewhat of the Opinion of those unconcerned Philosophers, that maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed indifferency in these matters, and dare not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to justifie him for all he did, or did not; but I would propose to these Discontents, that perhaps he did what he could; and if he had been too busie, and ingrossing of all Royal Favour, he had endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered his own Safety, and Self-preservation is a sufficient excuse; He had a hard Game to Play, and it was his Wisdome as well as Interest, to be humble and modest. I know many other Loyal and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Souls that had served and suffered in the Kings Business, who had free access, and hearty welcome from him, yet he was not able to redeem them from their fatal Poverty; who may look upon his Pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity with a little too much Envy and unpleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; to these I would suggest, That when he placed any Favours, it was upon them and their Fellow-Sufferers; yet the <hi>Cold Streamers</hi> might in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son have claimed precedency before them, because of their Assistance and Faithfulness, accompanied with Success and Victory; and the others deserved well, but they were to require Payment elsewhere; for he had Engagements enough upon the Accompt of the Restoration, to which many of the old Royalists would, but could not, be serviceable.</p>
            <p>After all these, who are men that are more Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of themselves, and their own Passions, than of Vertue and publick Safety. There are a new sort of Philosophers, the <hi>Ingeniosi</hi> about the Town, who think none wise but those that Cant in their
<pb facs="tcp:55301:10"/> idle Dialect; whose whole business is to censure and scorn what is brave and generous in others, and do nothing themselves, but what is vain and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent: Spirituals, Morals, and the Politicks are not Subjects worthy of their Inquisition; we may bear with them, when some of them dare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure the <hi>Divinity,</hi> and make War with <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. He that is not an Atheist, is unlearned, and he that doth not Socinianize in denying the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion (that is) the Godhead of our blessed Savior <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> is but a weak Divine in their Opinions: This Discourse will meet but with ill dealing at their Hands, but let them Bark, they cannot Bite; I hope no great Persons are desirous of an Oblivion of this Service, it would be of a dangerous Consequence, and introduce a President for Ingratitude; if Vertue be not remembred as well as rewarded (the one is but a part of the other) it may be discouraged in after Ages.</p>
            <p>Of all degrees of Men, the Author doth expect a good acceptation of this Work from the Souldiery, and such as are Professors in the <hi>Art of War,</hi> to whom he wisheth Vertue equal to the Subject he treats of, and as great success; this is the Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness and Faction of the Age We live in, that to please one Party, is to procure the certain Enmity of all the rest. This Relator doth not look for any kind Entertainment that this Discourse will find with the most men, and hopes and prayes that he may not have offended the Great God, by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of the business of his Calling for some few
<pb facs="tcp:55301:11"/> Moneths, in which Imployment he takes more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, than others in all their Honours and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. He hath nothing to Request of the Reader, but that if he find any content or benefit in this Work, that he returneth Glory to God, to whom all Praise is due, and give his Thanks to his Grace, my Lord Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who is the sole Patron of these Papers, and redeemed them from perpetual Night and Oblivion.</p>
            <p>The Relator could Publish many things that would discover the Envy and Ingratitude of some Persons, but thinks it more Generous and Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an to forget Injuries, than to requite them. Most of his Papers have been out of his reach in this time, and doubts not, but many matters worthy of Knowledge might further be made Publick, and may be in <hi>Time,</hi> which is the Mother of <hi>Truth.</hi>

               <hi>There will necessarily be some Errataes in this Relation, and whose Life can be without. These must not be charged upon the Authour, who had not the opportunity to over-look the Presse, but the Corrector, whom he relied upon.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Eorge Monk,</hi> Duke of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> whose Life I attempt to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe, was, The Son of Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Monk</hi> of <hi>Potheridge</hi> in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonshire,</hi> born on the sixth day of <hi>December,</hi> being <hi>Tuesday,</hi> in the Year 1608. A Gentleman of an ancient Family, whose Ancestors, though of great Revenues, by their great Hospitality, and other generous wayes of Expence, had much weakned and engaged their Estate; yet there still remained such a Competency as did well support the Dignity of that Family. He had three Sons, <hi>Thomas</hi> the eldest, who inherited the Estate, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55301:12"/>
               <hi>Nicholas</hi> his youngest, late Bishop of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1624"/> His second Son <hi>George</hi> was always desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be a Souldier by his Friends, and was brought up with his Grandfather, by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers side, Sir <hi>George Smith</hi> of the County of <hi>Devon,</hi> who was his Godfather, being past the sixteenth year of his age, there fell out an occasion that did hasten this Resolution, which may not be ungrateful to relate. About this time King <hi>Charles,</hi> of blessed Memory, came down to <hi>Plymouth</hi> to have an Eye to his Naval preparations, upon the breaking off of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Match, and a likelihood of a War with that Crown, (which was afterwards managed for a little time, and a suddain issue put to it) when Sir <hi>Thomas Monk,</hi> who in all such great Solemnities, used not to be one of the last, nor least in the business of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, being now by his Predecessors left under many Incumbrances upon his Estate, sent this his Son <hi>George</hi> to the Under-Sheriff with a good Present, and this Message, That he did not know what Judgments or Statutes might be against him, and upon his Lands; but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired that, without any prosecution, he might have the liberty to wait upon his Prince now visiting that County; who both acknowledged his desire just and reasonable, and assured his performance; and in testimony of his full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, did receive the gratuity from the young Gentleman (his son <hi>George</hi>); yet notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55301:12"/> he broke his Word, and in a most treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous manner seized the person of Sir <hi>Thomas Monk,</hi> upon an Execution, in the face of the whole Country, convened to receive his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty; which our young Gentleman (who had received his engagement to the contrary) could not digest with patience, but goes to <hi>Exeter</hi> and finds out this Under-Sheriff, and expostulates his falsehood and injustice, and then gave him a due Chastisement, (as he well deserved) and had not some persons present interposed, he had left him in a worse conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet without the intention of Blood or Murther.</p>
            <p>This was like another <hi>Manlius,</hi> that delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Father from the Persecutions of a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> that conspired his destruction, and afterwards proved one of the best Captains of that Common-wealth. So did this great Souldier, like the ancient Heroes who took their swords from the <hi>Altar,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated the beginnings of their Warfare with the initiations of Piety. Thus he began in a pious War for his Father, and ended all his Warlike Services for the Father of his Country; He was alwayes observed to be a most obedient and observant Son to both his Parents, which was a sure presage of his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Prosperity; there being nothing that can more oblige Heaven, than to oblige those that Heaven hath s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55301:13"/> and Princes: Piety is alwayes attended with Prosperity in this or a better World, and never any lost themselves in the way of Duty and Obedience.</p>
            <p>Upon this <hi>Contrasto,</hi> he was forced to avoid the fury of this inraged Lawyer, to turn Souldier sooner than his Friends desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; being then very young, not arrived at the seventeenth year of his age: But being recommended to the care of Sir <hi>Richard Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill</hi> his near Kinsman, a Gentleman that was a Captain of great Renown in the late Wars, and one that did uphold the honour of that brave and martial Family of the <hi>Greenvills,</hi> from whom he first received Arms, and was his Pupil in the Art of War, whom he always did acknowledge as his first Master in that Profession, and remembred him with a great deal of honour and thankfulness. What was the issue of that Voyage into <hi>Spain,</hi> we have neither reason nor content to relate, 'tis not pleasing to remember Mistakes or Miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, whereof the wisest men may be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>Afterwards, upon the War with <hi>France,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1626"/> he was in those Expeditions to the <hi>Isle of Rhee and Rochell,</hi> where then he carried Colours under that valiant and old Commander Sir <hi>John Burroughs</hi> (if I do remember his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,) w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o also (as young as he then was) would often relate with grief the ill Conduct
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55301:13"/> of that Affair, by which the <hi>English</hi> reaped nothing but Reproach and Dishonour, and yet wanted neither Courage nor Gallantry; sometimes the best Projects may be disappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, without the negligence of those Agents that are imployed.</p>
            <p>Afterwards all being peace in <hi>England,</hi> and he having espoused himself to his Sword, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to go to the School of War in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Provinces, where he learned Obedience to his Superiors, and to exact Discipline of those under his Command. And indeed these brave <hi>Princes of Orange</hi> were the best Masters in that Art that this modern Age hath produced; in the Regiment of the <hi>Loyall Lord Vere</hi> (I mean the <hi>Earl of Oxford</hi>) he had his Education as a Souldier, the other Voyages to <hi>Cadice</hi> and <hi>Rhee</hi> being like Play-days to young Schollars; but here he learned both to Fight and to be Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. Courage is not to be learned, but it may be confirmed by use and practice; but vertue is the better Lesson.</p>
            <p>'Tis too daring an Assertion, to call this Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Mart of War and Courage a Seminary of irreligion and disloyalty, where so many brave Spirits of the <hi>English</hi> Nation have gathered Lawrels; who there learned, and taught the Arts of War, and were alwayes reckoned in the List of our Worthies, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he <hi>Veeres, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises, Morgans,</hi> and many others. And it was never accounted Mercenary by our Ancestors,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55301:14"/> but the pursuing the true Interests of <hi>England,</hi> and the security of the Reformed Religion; But some men are so faln out of love with ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that while they ought to praise it, they persecute it with reproach and scorn. The profession of a Souldier no man can honour too much, when he ventures his Life for the safety of his King and Country: But if they turn mercenary, and cut mens throats for pay and plunder, a Butcher and an Hangman ought to be preferred before them, who follow lawful Vocations. It was a sad resentment of a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal of <hi>France,</hi> who upon his death-bed, when a Divine came to comfort him, broke out into these Exclamations, If God were not infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly merciful, no man in my condition could be saved, having burnt so many Cities and Towns, murthered so many Innocents, and undone so many poor people by plunder and Pillage; This no religious man could deny; yet an honest Souldier is beloved of Heaven, as <hi>Joshua</hi> that did Fight the Lords Battels, of whom the Sun and Moon were inamoured for his vertue, and stood still to a Miracle to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his Courage: so that all brave Souls, that govern themselves by the Rules of Justice and Piety, need not be ashamed of this noble Profession, when it is not only allowed, but also commended in the Scriptures, and God himself owns them as their General, and as one of the great<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55301:14"/>
               <hi>The Lord of Hosts.</hi> Sin did introduce a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of Arms, without which Good Laws are of no use; for it is Power that puts them into Force and Execution, and the Souldier, as well as the Magistrate, carrieth Gods Sword; War being the highest execution of Divine Justice, and never lawful, but when justice cannot be had any other way, and it's the last Appeal and Remedy, and trusted solely in the Hands of Soveraign Princes; so that for Priests or People to play with this edged Tool, it will prove very dangerous, and seldom but procures their Temporal, and without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance their Eternal destruction.</p>
            <p>Afterwards, he was in the Regiment under the Command of the Lord <hi>Goring,</hi> eldest Son of the Earl of <hi>Norwich,</hi> a Noble man of great parts, but some few extravagancies; He learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the best, but was far remote from the other, and commanding his Company, though many times consisting of above two hundred, and of them one hundred Volunteers, and Gentlemen of Name and good Estate in <hi>England,</hi> and sometimes several Lords who lived upon their own Fortunes in a splendid manner; yet he kept them in such good Order and Discipline, that I have heard many of them give him thanks for his severity many years after. At that time it was no place for Cowards to shelter in, but a Stage for great Action; and though the wary <hi>Dutch</hi> would not hazard
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55301:15"/> much in Battels, knowing their difficulty of recruiting, yet every Summer was renowned for some famous Seige, and wherein he was alwayes concerned, though in no great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, yet a person of good Remark and Fame even in that station (where he had a Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be Captain.) He was a Gentleman that did not understand that it was the part of a Souldier to Swear and Drink, and Debauch poor Women into Uncleanness, nor their Commendation; but to be diligent and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in their Duty, Loyal towards those that employed them, and especially vertuous and religious towards God Almighty; From hence it was, That it pleased God both to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him from dangers (whose Life consisted of nothing else) and to advance him to the greatest Dignities that an honest Subject was capable of; But what if we reap nothing in in this World, a Christians Harvest is in a better.</p>
            <p>After many years of Service there, there happened a difference between the Town of <hi>Dort</hi> and himself, which is the first and most priviledged place in all <hi>Holland,</hi> and most pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful with the States General (where were his Winter-Quarters) about Jurisdiction. The Magistrates assuming to punish and affront the Souldiers under his Command, which he could in no wise endure, though he would make them do their Duties, yet he would not suffer
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55301:15"/> the insolent Burgers to interpose in his Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Authority; upon this the Town appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the States General, and though the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> stood close to the Souldiery, yet by the influence of the <hi>Heere de Witt</hi> (a Predecessor of this Gentleman that now hath a great superintendency of the Affairs of the United Provinces) he was necessitated to change the Quarters of his Company for a worse; which he did not well relish, for that upon the first occasion he did quit their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and looked upon them as persons that did not know how to value those that were prodigal of their Blood and Lives, to preserve them in liberty and safety. Nothing can be so odious to a brave spirit as ingratitude, but especially to be ingrate to Souldiers, who are ready to dye for us: Souldiers and Physitians are scarce regarded or remembred but in the time of extremity; and it is the Crime of Mankind onely to value them of whom they have present need.</p>
            <p>Upon his Return into <hi>England,</hi> there was but too much employment for men of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, when the <hi>Scottish</hi> Nation entred into that unhappy War for the pretences of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, (too good a preface for Rebellion) but such was the fate of those Times, that they which would seem most godly, did really prove the worst of men, both against their King and Coun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55301:16"/> A strange Treachery or Madness to bring out such an Army (of which the General used to say, <hi>That he had never seen such gallant Horse and Foot in all his Time, Men able to have redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced many such Kingdomes as Scotland</hi>) to expose them to have their Throats cut by an Enemy not half armed. But this ill managed War proceeded not only from the treachery of men, but certainly from the hand of God, to punish these Nations for their sins, who did not know how to prize their Peace and Plenty with Thankfulness to God, and Obedience to their King: for murmuring and discontent under Gods Mercies procures the greatest Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>A little before this time, when the planting of <hi>Madagascar</hi> was in agitation, and about one thousand Gentlemen were treating, and had agreed to go in person with Servants, and to carry a stock of One thousand pounds a piece; He Resolved to make one, which doubtlesse would have been a designe of great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to themselves, and to this Nation; for he was a person of such diligence and worth, that like <hi>Cato Senior,</hi> in whatsoever condition he had engaged, he had found or made a great Fortune. But what God then was pleased to stop, afterwards he hath compleated in that great and worthy Plantation at <hi>Carolina,</hi> by a Grant from his Majestie to himself and many other noble Planters.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:55301:17"/>
            <p>The General had a good opinion of Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as much conducing to the encrease of Trade in our Nation, which are of such strength, as may easily reduce the rest of those Countries to Obedience, even the rich <hi>Spanish</hi> Provinces, but that they apply themselves to Ttaffick and Husbandry more than to Martial Imployments. There scarce ever being since Colonies were first planted, one such as <hi>New England,</hi> which drives a Trade with above four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score Sail of great Ships, besides Fisher-men, and other lesser Vessels upon the Coast; and is able to raise above forty thousand men, and not leave the Country unfurnished for Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, and all this growth within about a little more than fifty years. But their niceness in point of Religion, that none but those of ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered Churches have any interest in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, is not approved; which, instead of reducing those ignorant Indians to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, is like to expose many Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to an aversion by their exclusion from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments and other Church Communion, if it doth not also introduce some dangerous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion; for the most do alwayes expect to Rule in a Community and elective Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as they pretend this to be under his Majesty, as according to the Law of corrupt nature they ought, and by their Power and Force they will: No English-man can be an En<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Yet though these Plantations do advance Trade, they do exhaust our People, wherein we are wanting rather than abounding, and in time may, like <hi>Spain,</hi> be a little desolated, if this humour encreaseth of transplanting. This was the reason, as some affirm, That King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, one of the wisest of our Princes, did refuse the Project of their disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very when it was tendred to him.</p>
            <p>But many good men do affirm, That the great reason of Gods restraint of his Blessing upon many of these worthy Endeavors, is our neglect of the propagation of Religion, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amongst the Natives, but our own Planters, who by their confused Habitations, and no sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of Church-men, degenerate into a kind of Barbarisme and Impiety; and study more their Profit, than Religion and Honesty; but from this Accusation, <hi>New England</hi> doth clear it self. The great end of the discovery of those great and formerly unknown Countries, by Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, was, That the Knowledge of his Name, and of his Son Jesus Christ, might be manifested; but when our Planters, who should be the Instruments and means of this Publication, themselves degenerate in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Here, after many Services, the <hi>Lords Justices and Councel</hi> taking notice both of his Zeal, Faithfulness and Courage, were pleased to appoi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t him <hi>Governour of Dublin,</hi> that was, to commit all that was left, to his Custody: For little had the Protestants of <hi>Ireland</hi> now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining but this City, and a Town or two in <hi>Munster,</hi> and in the North, and those with whom they could not Communicate; so that certainly it was necessary to be frugal &amp; care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of these last remains. But whatever was the cause, suddainly from <hi>England</hi> a new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission was brought for another person, which was not so acceptable either to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors or governed; to the last of which change is too often, not unpleasing; though too often it brings great Troubles to them that most desire it.</p>
            <p>This might appear a distrust, but groundless, for never was he satisfied in a Quarrel better,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55301:19"/> nor engaged more there fully then against the Authors of this horrid Rebellion; for when no temptations of Honour or Profit would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure him out of Prison, to take Arms in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in that cursed and unnatural War; when they propounded Service in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently embraced, and, I am sure, with no forfeiture of Loyalty, which he never Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrackt (whatsoever those that cannot discern beyond the surface of Affairs, may ignorantly judge). For he never drew his Sword against any that Fought with the Kings immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Commission, but of this more after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>Upon the Cessation (which, it may be, was not so much after his Heart, as the prosecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the War; though Obedience was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes his Sacrifice) his Regiment was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to the Kings assistance in <hi>England;</hi> and because some injury was done to him, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grading him from the Government of <hi>Dublin,</hi> (and whom we injure we suspect) <hi>Colonell War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,</hi> his own Major had the Conduct of it; He also came over in very good grace and favour, and was presented to his Majesty, of blessed Memory, by the <hi>Lord Digby</hi> (then Secretary of State) in <hi>Christ-Church</hi> Garden at <hi>Oxford.</hi> That noble person, the Earl of <hi>Bristoll,</hi> hath and had alwayes an high value for him, and did then use his Endeavour with his Majesty, that he might be imployed in some considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55301:20"/> Command. But <hi>Colonell Monk</hi> dealt very frankly with his Majesty, that as his Forces were then managed, no good could be done, whosoever Commanded, none would obey, and that want of Discipline would be the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of that Army; but made proposition to his Majesty, That if ten thousand men picked out of all his Majesties Forces, and such Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers trusted to Command as were known and experienced in the Art of War, and that had lived under Discipline abroad, that he would not doubt to maintain them by their Swords points, and reduce his Enemies to such terms, as they should be weary of the War, and the King did willingly listen to it; and, no doubt, he would certainly have performed it: For Colonell <hi>Monk</hi> did not play with the Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Souldier, but made it his business and study to do his duty; he did not like the State of the Forces of <hi>Oxford,</hi> who were (though couragious enough, yet for want of Obedience to their Officers) unable for any great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe, &amp; very much disposed to their own ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, from themselves as well as their Enemies.</p>
            <p>Some Regiments were newly returned from <hi>Ireland</hi> (whereof his own was one) so that he was sent to <hi>Nantwich</hi> to look over those Forces, and such others as were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quartered in those parts; the King having a full Resolution to intrust him with a Command suitable to his proposition, (though he did not
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55301:20"/> propound for himself, he had alwayes too much humility, but for a good and fit Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander to head them) but God (who would not suffer such a Blessing to these Nations, who were yet to suffer under the scourge of a long and tedious Civil War) did disappoint this probable Remedy, and hinder the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. For Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> out of <hi>Yorkshire</hi> with a good Force, surprizes the <hi>Irish</hi> Forces, and with them Colonell <hi>Monk</hi> (so then called) who had no Command there at that time, and sent him Prisoner to <hi>Hull,</hi> where he continued, and was afterwards com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded up, to be lodged in a safer Custody in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> by the Parliaments special Order; Jealous of his great Conduct, because of his Vertue, which to them was dangerous, and therefore hateful; too often Justice and Honesty cause Suffering, rather than Honour and Preferment.</p>
            <p>And now he is sure in the Tower of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> there they Resolve to keep him, and there he languisheth many years, and hears from none of his Friends; They are remote in <hi>Devonshire,</hi> under the Kings Quarters, and could not furnish him; he a younger Brother, and in the Fashion, his Condition being straitned in a small Annuity, and that not well paid; no care is taken for his Exchange, and indeed it was no easie matter to procure, for the Parliament knew the value of this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55301:21"/> by their Commissioners from <hi>Dublin,</hi> and they had some dark intelligence of the Kings Conference with him at <hi>Oxford,</hi> so that they would with a great deal of difficulty have parted with him. Vertue is often the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of suffering; and men of no worth, as they are less regarded, so not persecuted: Some endeavour there was about his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, but the Courtiers out-ran him, and got the advantage, by Friends, to get out of Prison before him; when Favour is pursued, the Souldier cannot contend with the Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Yet to shew his late Majesty could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern men, he sent him an hundred pounds in Gold, a testimony of his Kindness, and a great sum at that time, when <hi>Oxford</hi> and the Indies had little Commerce; which he hath been often heard to mention with no small thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness. And I believe that that bounty of his Majesty (so I call it, as it was at that time) did very much endear and oblige him to His Family; And we see the Reward of Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, what the Father could not do by reason of the Iniquity of the Time, the Son of this Great King hath at large obliged him and his Family; and thereby laid an everlasting Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation upon all his People to be Loyal, and consecrated an Altar to Gratitude, to teach it to all succeeding Ages.</p>
            <p>This great Soul could not but be under great Languors, to lie in rust among the old
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55301:21"/> Arms of the Tower, when he used to be covered with bright Steel, in the midst of Wounds and Dangers (the greatest pleasure to an Heroick Spirit) and now to moulder away in the confinement of a close Prison, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so disagreeing to an active Mind as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint and Idleness; But if he will accept a great Command, and promise Trust to the Parliament, one of the best shall entertain him. But no Prison was so loathsome as Disloyalty, and an Evil Conscience: All their Flatteries and Promises could not tempt him to any Command in <hi>England;</hi> there in Prison he will die, rather than relinquish; and he scorned to make a Contract, with an intention to break it. The Souldier that can make Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, and break them unjustly, forfeits all Honour and Gallantry, and ought to be listed among the base and cowardly.</p>
            <p>Imprisonment is a kind of lingring Death, and we are beholding to our Ancestors for providing for the liberty of our Persons, as well as the property of our Estates, by many good Laws, and often renewed. To be confined to stone Walls and Iron Bars, is most contrary to the nature of man, who is a social Creature; what would he not do for his Freedome, unreasonable Creatures teach us this Lesson: The little Birds that are provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with all Necessaries both to nourish and delight, yet being restrained in a Prison, sing
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55301:22"/> sadly, and strive for liberty, choosing rather to live upon Providence in Freedom, than to have Man their Caterer in the Cage.</p>
            <p>He having been a close Prisoner for many years, which suited neither to his former active life, nor to his present state of health; He, at last, by the sollicitation of the <hi>Lord Lisle</hi> (Son to the Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> a Family to whom he was much obliged for old Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, and for some Assistance while he was a Prisoner in the Tower) who was going Lord Deputy into <hi>Ireland,</hi> that he would take a Regiment, and accompany him thither: This was a War wherein he alwayes was a ready Volunteer, to Revenge the Innocent Blood of the Protestants there barbarously shed; and thereunto he gave him his promise; but there followed a great Obstruction, for before he could be released, he was to fall down and worship the <hi>Scottish</hi> Idol of the Covenant; but this was a Condition that he could not easily submit to, being an Idolatry that would not at all be a Charm against the Irish Idolaters, whom he was going to teach other Doctrine with his Swords point, that is, of Obedience to God and the King. He had many Conferences both with the Clergy and Layety, his Fellow-suff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rers, in the Tower about this Matter: What was the Issue of their Councels, and whether he took the Covenant, I cannot well affirm upon certainty;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55301:22"/> but this I know, he loved not the remembrance of that troublesome Firebrand, that se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Confusion, and confirmed it in these Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>A story I heard in <hi>Scotland</hi> about this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which may not much interrupt our Relation, and be a little worth Observation; when the Parliament Forces were very low, and the Kings Armies Triumphant, both in the North and West, they sent Commissioners to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> to invite their Brethren to their Assistance, but the <hi>Scots</hi> would not touch, for all the promises of Pay, and such kind of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements (which some may scruple to Credit) unless the <hi>English</hi> would joyn with them in the same Covenant. <hi>Vane,</hi> a cunning person, one of the Commissioners, who never had any kindness for that Invention, whether he thought it a little too express for Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, which he then projected to Ruine, would by no means yield to this hard Condition; but strict Directions coming from <hi>England,</hi> to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit upon any Terms, with an account of their danger there: Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> would by all means have it called a <hi>League</hi> as well as a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> and disputed it almost all Night, and at last carried it. Another debate he held about Church-Government, which was to be according to the Example of the best Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches; he would have it according to the Word of God onely; but after a great<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55301:23"/> Contest, they joyned both, and the last had the Precedence; one of his Fellows after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards expostulating his Reason, that he should put them to so much trouble, with such need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Trifles; He told him, That he was mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and did not see far enough into that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for a League shewed, it was between two Nations, and might be broken upon just Reasons, but not a Covenant. For the other, That Church-Government, according to the Word of God, by the Difference of Divines and Expositors, would be long enough before it be determined, for the Learnedest held it clearly for Episcopacy; so that when all are agreed, we may take in the <hi>Scotch</hi> Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</p>
            <p>This Covenant was imposed when I was a Child, and was almost forgotten in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but the renouncing of it, lately revived the Memory and Discourse of it. Balls of Wild Fire and Contention should be quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and buried in silence, and cast out of the way of Mens Notice and Observation, that they may raise no more Flames or Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; Water is more necessary than Fire or Zeal amongst a divided People; <hi>Moses</hi> that delivered the <hi>Israelites,</hi> was of a calme and meek spirit; and, without Controversie, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is so healing of the Wounds of a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as Forgiveness and Forgetfulness.</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:55301:23"/>
            <p>But at last he goes into <hi>Munster</hi> with the Lord Deputy <hi>Lisle,</hi> (for, as I have heard, <hi>Dublin</hi> would not receive that Chief Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor) and there continues with him till his Commission expired, which was no long time; for he was so long preparing for this Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he could not stay long there, and was hastened away by the Lord <hi>Inchequeen,</hi> who re-entred into his Government as Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of that Province; Colonel <hi>Monk</hi> returns with him, and is caressed by the Parliament to undertake the Command of the <hi>Brittish</hi> Forces in the North of <hi>Ireland;</hi> which he accepts, and so visits that Nation the third time, where he has under Command both the <hi>Scottish</hi> and the <hi>English</hi> Forces: He did great Services against the Rebels, and did manifest so much Justice in the civil administration of Affairs there, (then there was no Law but what was from the military Governors in that Province of <hi>Ulster</hi>) that many Resolutions of his, in case of difference between Party and Party re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main without further Controversie to this day. And he hath an admirable Memory amongst all the Protestants of those Northern Parts; for in a barren Country, with small Assistance from <hi>England,</hi> he did with Booties and good Husbandry, maintain a long and sharp War with the most hardy and stoutest Rebels, which were those under <hi>Owen Roe, Oneale,</hi> an old experienced Officer, that had
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55301:24"/> been Governour of <hi>Arras</hi> for the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and one that trained his Souldiers to a notable Experience and Resolution; but Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Monk</hi> (now Commander in chief) made him uneasie in that part of the Country, and laid it so desolate, that he was forced to seek for new Quarters; The sure way to remove an Enemy, is to cut off Provisions, without Provender the Steed will starve; this is the safest method to obtain Victory, which many great Armies have experienced, that have delivered their Arms, and made themselves Prisoners for Bread and Water. Had <hi>Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> desolated two or three Provinces in the lesser <hi>Asia,</hi> and declined Fighting, the young <hi>Macedonian</hi> might have been contented with his own Demesnes, and been glad to have run home for his Break-fast; If <hi>Cromwel</hi> had been thus treated, when he invaded the <hi>Scots,</hi> he had never been <hi>Protector. Harold</hi> lost the Crown of <hi>England</hi> by an error of this kind, an Invader comes to Fight, and we must never please an Enemy.</p>
            <p>And in the whole of that Government, no man performed the part of a good Captain, nor of a just Judge better; so that this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegme did not ill become him; what others discoursed of in long Harangues, he executed in honest and prudent Actions: But while he thus plies publique Affairs, he doth not forget the OEconomicks; for both he and his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55301:24"/> turn good Husbandmen, and out of those desolate Fields digged both Pay and Provision, and did there (when a Batchelor) keep great Hospitality; for his Officers had scarce any thing to live on, but the benefit of his Table. Good Husbandry is commendable at all times, but most requisi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e in times of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Necessity; and he that cannot spare some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, as well as spend, will never arrive at a great Fortune, nor keep it, though it be his Inheritance.</p>
            <p>In that year the <hi>Scots</hi> all forsook his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: And <hi>Monroe</hi> had a designe to seize him; but he that was alwayes upon his Watch, and did look upon it as the chief duty of a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier to have good intelligence, which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wanted, (being easie of access all the day, and very humble and familiar in all his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation) prevented <hi>Monroe,</hi> and secured him, and several other chief Officers; and then makes an Agreement with <hi>Owen Oneale</hi> for some moneths, and furnishes him with Ammunition, upon condition, that he should relieve <hi>Londonderry,</hi> wherein Sir <hi>Charles Cool</hi> was besieged by the <hi>Scottish</hi> Forces: This Action, little can be said for it, but the usual Arguments of Necessity and Self-preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. These in pretence, some have abused to the Patronage of the greatest Villanies, and 'tis an easie matter to urge a necessity of our own making, but it was not so at this time,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55301:25"/> for the GENERALL was in great straits.</p>
            <p>But however, he is left with not above Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen Men to defend <hi>Dundalk,</hi> all the rest revolting to the Earl of <hi>Inchequeen,</hi> who was sent to reduce those Parts, which he soon quitted, for to obtain a Passe for <hi>England,</hi> whither he speeds, and in the way meets with <hi>Cromwel</hi> going over to the Relief of <hi>Dublin; Cromwel</hi> tells him in what danger he was in, advised him to apply himself to such particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Friends of his, to whom he writ earnestly in his behalf, and furnishing him with Monies, dismist him, some say; It concerned <hi>Cromwel</hi> very much, for it was by his special Order and Command, that this Agreement was made; Colonell <hi>Monk</hi> taking it upon himself, as done like a Souldier, in the case of extreme necessity, it obliged <hi>Cromwel</hi> ever after to him; for there are some evil men that good turns will endear, and certainly they must be very bad that no kindnesse can oblige, of which we in this last Age have known many.</p>
            <p>Friendship and Magnificence are strangers in this World; Interest and Profit are the Principles by which all is swayed, and he that expects any thing otherwise, will find himself fairly deceived.</p>
            <pb n="29" facs="tcp:55301:25"/>
            <p>Being arrived at <hi>London,</hi> he was exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned about that Agreement, and there were many Members that had a great desire that Colonell <hi>Monk</hi> should confess what they did but justly suspect, and in part could not but know, that he would never have dared in a matter of such danger without encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from <hi>Cromwel</hi> and others; and a great many of the Members were so highly dissatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that they moved to Commit him to his old Lodgings in the Tower. But the Politicians of the House looked upon it as an action of the greatest advantage to them; therefore one of them Replyed, That it was fitter to commit the Tower to him. Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning men that understand their Interest, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver discourage those that pursue it; and this is the ruine of those that Govern, when they do not discern those that can serve them best.</p>
            <p>There were other ill Consequences of this Agreement, besides the displeasing the <hi>Rump;</hi> but the <hi>Scottish</hi> Officers deserting him, and purposing to seize him; with not very good usage from some others in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> did provoke him into this Agreement; Injury must never provoke a good man to go out of the right way.</p>
            <p>And now he had leisure to see his Friends, being out of all Imployment, but long he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues not in a state of Quietness; some men
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55301:26"/> are born for motion; and though we must allow this Gentleman to be as Fortunate as any other ever was, especially in such unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Times, where those unheard of Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges crushed many both out of their Lives and Fortunes, and yet all contributed to this great advantage; but we must also affirm, That it was a Tribute due to his Vertues; the Age being so barren of great Spirits, that, upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, he was very necessary; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his great Felicities, he found some Allay, there being no mans Nest to be found, though built never so high, but hath a thorn in it: And as there are no pure Elements without some mixture, so there is no pure Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity while we live here among the Elements, all meet with Check, and most with Check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots,</hi> though they had been a long time troublesome to his Majesties Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of blessed Memory <hi>(I mean</hi> Charles <hi>the Martyr),</hi> yet when they saw the tragick issue of those Unhappy Differences, the Murther of heir Royal Soveraign at his own Gate, and the Expulsion, and endeavoured Extirpation of his Posterity, unto which sad ends, some of them did contribute too much, both by their Actions and Councels, but undoubtedly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out such Barbarous Intentions; They are a People led too much by the Authority of their Ministers, (Extreams alwayes unsafe). Some
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55301:26"/> of these Ministers so affected with that popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar parity in the Church, which they will not endure in their Families, and so misled by a kind of Ignorant and Fanatick Zeal, that they did not stick to set Three Nations on a Flame, that they might by the heat thereof, Sacrifice to this Idol of <hi>Calvins</hi> invention at <hi>Geneva,</hi> which might be proportioned to the precincts of that little City; but not at all calculated to the Meridian of greater Kingdomes and States; there is not a more Loyal Nobility and Gentry in the World, however the Lying Spirit entred into their false Prophets to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them at that time, and so they demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated in the year, 1650. When they had formerly digged a Grave, and helped to bury this ancient Monarchy, then they would have revived it with the loss of their Lives, and all that was dear to them; and in order to this good end, they renounced any Alliance with the pretended High and Mighty States of <hi>England,</hi> and sent to <hi>Breda</hi> Commissioners to bring home his Majesty to the ancient Throne of his Predecessors. This demonstrates, that though they did grievously err in their Means and Methods, yet their Aim was never to ruine the Monarchy; but men that go out of Gods way, meet with Gods Judgments.</p>
            <p>Herein they were but too scrupulous to clog Majesty with such hard Conditions, that they thereby disobliged their Soveraign, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55301:27"/> the Divisions of their own Country, and exposed it to Ruine; but the blame is to be justly placed upon some violent Spirits that had begun and continued their Troubles, and were then in sole Authority, and afraid to be brought to condigne Punishment; But then and now are a Loyal Party in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the most considerable of the Nobility and Gentry, that abhorred that manner of dealing with his Majesty. And the others did sufficient Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for it, under the Power and Tyranny of the <hi>English,</hi> who were Rods to punish their Disloyalty, though afterwards God threw them into the Fire.</p>
            <p>The <hi>English</hi> Common-wealths-men did not like the Neighbourhood of the Son of a King, in the blood of whose Father they had but lately bathed their hands; They Resolve to send an Army into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and General <hi>Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax</hi> is desired to accept of this Command, but he who had lamented in Dust and Ashes his former Compliance with them; and indeed this honest Gentleman (however he is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood) did heartily repent of that horrid Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his Majesty, being cheated by that Impostor <hi>Cromwel,</hi> who with long Prayers and Tears, held him employed to seek advice from God, what they should do, till the mischief was executed. A strange and horrid Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to subborn God to so great Wickednesse; but in that Age nothing was more familiar,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55301:27"/> than this Diabolical Hypocrisie, which is the highest provocation of Gods Wrath.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Fairfax</hi> as he shewed Contrition for that unhappy station wherein he was placed, and did not nor could make any prevention; so he did make satisfaction for that neglect, when he so freely offered his Service to <hi>General Monk</hi> when he declared in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but upon this Condition, that he should restore the ancient model of the <hi>English</hi> Government. But this Gentleman might also remember, that he was a <hi>Scotch</hi> Baron, and so had some Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to that Country for his Title; which had <hi>James</hi> Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> considered himself as <hi>Earl of Cambridge,</hi> he might have kept his Head upon his Shoulders, and <hi>Scotland</hi> might have found another General, though not a Duke, yet a little fitter for that Imployment. But though <hi>Fairfax</hi> will not accept, yet <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> will swallow this morsel (for which indeed he long gaped). And now was <hi>Oliver</hi> Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, judging that there is but a little way to remove to a Throne, from being an ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous General, to a new hatched Common-wealth. This Panther was desirous of the poysonful Aconite of unlawful Power and Greatnesse, you it was above his reach, yet would strain to the breaking his own Neck to obtain it.</p>
            <p>He went down with an Army both of Horse and Foot, most excellently well furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55301:28"/> and provided for; and some think that many Gentlemen that had served his Majesty in <hi>England,</hi> either in Revenge of the old Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, or to shift themselves into a Condition of Subsistance, went a long <hi>incogniti,</hi> which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards appeared very certainly, when many Officers that marched in with the General, produced Testimonies of their Loyalty and Perseverance in his late Majesties Army to the last, which did not a little conduce to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Generals declaring; For these men had but hid their Principles, not rased them; and many T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oopers that there listed themselves, were men of good Parts and Learning, which some thought were Jesuits; but that was an ignorant jealousie, for it was there a good Imployment for a Gentleman, and as competent Provision, to have near twenty Shillings by the Week, and live well, and Gentleman-like, keeping themselves and their Horse, for some six shillings a Week; and there were known many young Physitians, and other Students in other liberal Arts, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions that thought it a Preferment. Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity puts men upon many shifts, but they ought never to go out of the way of Vertue and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty, for then they will return by Weeping-Cross.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Cromwel</hi> would not stir without his darling <hi>Colonell Monk,</hi> as he esteemed him, whom he sent for in all Councels of War pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55301:28"/> to this March, and would not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve without his Advice any thing of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and used such artifice, as he would not be denyed his Company. Some say, Good men are bettered by bad Company, as Roses and Lillies planted by Garlick smell sweeter; this is dangerous to Experiment. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised him a Regiment before he entred into <hi>Scotland,</hi> which he performed, drawing six Companies out of <hi>Hasleriggs,</hi> six out of <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicks</hi> Regiments; the one Garrisoned at <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> the other at <hi>Newcastle.</hi> And thus our Colonel is now engaged with them, but with little content (I dare affirm); yet the <hi>Scottish</hi> affront in the North of <hi>Ireland</hi> did not yet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest with him, and perhaps his aversion to that Nation for their beginning of the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of his Native Country, and kindling that Fire that he had been twice endeavouring to quench in the two former <hi>Scottish</hi> Expeditions under his late Majesty, and withall spirited with the Universal Opinion of the Kings Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they were worthy to feel the Rod for their former disregard and unkindness to <hi>Charles the First;</hi> whether these, or any of these, I will not affirm; but sure I am, after his Residence there as Commander in Chief, when the Wars were ended; He did observe well the Loyalty and Honour of the Nobility and Gentry, and no man had an higher esteem of that Nation, and no man ever attained more
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55301:29"/> Love and Reverence in a strange Country, that was there upon the score he was, I mean, to hold them in Servitude and Subjection: Of this more afterwards.</p>
            <p>But yet we cannot but observe, That it must be a great Vertue that Enemies use to fall in Love withall; being entred with the <hi>English</hi> Army, by the wisest Observers, there he was accompted the tutelar Angel thereof, and at <hi>Musselborough</hi> and <hi>Gladsmore,</hi> where the <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> Forces made brave Attaques, and were in great possibility of keeping their <hi>English</hi> Guests in more narrow Quarters (I mean defeating them) and making them Prisoners; for they were grievously harassed with continual Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larums and Infals of the Enemy, so that they were wasted to about Eight Thousand; when they entred <hi>Scotland,</hi> they were above twenty thousand, many falling Sick, and sent away by the <hi>English</hi> Ships; so that both at <hi>Musselborough</hi> and <hi>Gladsmore</hi> Colonell <hi>Monk</hi> (then made <hi>Lieutenant General</hi> of the Ordnance) shewed what was the difference between a Professor in the Art of War, well studied in all its Rules, and a Fanatick Souldier that Fights by Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Some would undervalue him in that Profession, but it shews them to be better at their Pen, than their Sword. He drew up the whole Army in a dark night, when they could not discern one another, and gave them such Directions where to draw up, that keeping
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55301:29"/> their stations for fear of the Enemy (who was then numerous and insulting) the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when they were able to discern one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they found themselves in a Figure both defensive, and fit for to make a Charge. But the <hi>Scottish</hi> Army had a purpose to make all sure at <hi>Copper-Smith</hi> pass, where one or two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments are able to give Check to the greatest Army; not unlike to the Streights of <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mopyle</hi> (if not worse) where <hi>Leonidas,</hi> King of <hi>Sparta,</hi> stopped the Army of the <hi>Persians,</hi> and made so many fall with an handful of men, and at last buried themselves among thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand of the Enemy slain, and they not above three hundred. But there were few valiant <hi>Spartans</hi> in this <hi>Scottish</hi> Army; for the Ministers had the modelling of it, and the greatest Hypocrites were their Favorites, and they are alwayes the greatest Cowards; but at this weakness of the Church-Governors, who would not wonder that they should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to the Shambles their own Proselites, and not let the Wicked (as they accompted) which were the Brave and Loyal, to hold Arms to defend their Country, of which there is not a gallanter Seminary in the World, as they have given proof in most parts of Christendome, though the great Genius of <hi>England</hi> hath alwayes been too predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for them. Yet they have had some times of advantage upon us, when God hath made
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55301:30"/> them Rods to scourge us for our Sins, but their Inroades never reached further than to the North parts of <hi>Yorkshire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It pleased <hi>Cromwel,</hi> being then at <hi>Dunbar,</hi> to call a Councel of War, and would have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his Hopes of the Protectorship to have been safe at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> when <hi>Monk</hi> urged a Battail, and that in the place where they were to assault the Enemy, as they were lodged round about them; there was great Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but he offered to undertake the Work; and as <hi>Brigadere</hi> with three Regiments of Foot at the Head of them, with his Pike in his Hand, he charged up the Hills that are above the Town from the Sea-side, and onely <hi>Lawers</hi> his Regiment of <hi>High-Landers</hi> made a good Defence, and the chief Officer, a Lieutenant-Colonell being slain by one of the Generals Sergeants, the Colonel was absent of the name of the <hi>Campbells,</hi> they stood to the push of the Pike, and were all cut in pieces; these were all the Foot that ingaged. For the <hi>Scotch</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry took the Rout, and ran away over the Sands towards <hi>Bell-Haven,</hi> and were most taken Prisoners. Tis truth, <hi>Lambert</hi> did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Service with the Horse in the persuite that day, and thus was the <hi>English</hi> Army sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and, as they say, many of the Loyal <hi>Scots</hi> were not over-sorry, being not suffered by the Presbytery to bear Arms for their Country: In this whole Expedition, Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55301:30"/>
               <hi>Monk</hi> did teach them to provide for an Army, Tents, and other Necessaries; for these violent Fanaticks had used to eat and lye well at Night, when they Fought in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> they found nothing but Mountains and Moors here to entertain them, so that they were to seek the knowledge of such a War: After this Battail, which was so astonishing to all the <hi>English,</hi> who could neither hope nor believe for such a Victory, it rendred Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell <hi>Monk</hi> of great Credit with all the Forces, but especially to <hi>Oliver,</hi> who now thought himself sure of his Principality over these Nations. So that receiving great Recruits from <hi>England</hi> (which a Victory does alwayes hasten, for all flock to the Conquerors in hopes of Spoil and Plunder) and many recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the sickness of their Fears, which is a dangerous Disease in an Army; He drew out very great Parties, and sent them out to take in several strong Castles: And Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-General <hi>Monk</hi> was imployed to besiege <hi>Tantallon,</hi> and some other strong Places, which he speedily effected, and thereby encreased in Reputation and Credit with the General, and seemed to bear the greatest sway in the Councels of War, which drew upon him the Envy of all the old Officers, who could not acquiesce in the Advancement and Credit of this new Comer; So that all the Reward that Vertue reaps from men of a base mettal, is
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55301:31"/> Malice and Malevolence for all her deserts: But <hi>Oliver</hi> was a Spirit too big and presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to be ruled by his little Underlings; therefore when he took his March after the <hi>Kings most Excellent Majesty</hi> unto <hi>Worcester,</hi> he left him Commander in Chief of all the Forces remaining, (which was no considerable Army) yet with it he did Wonders. Which were no pleasing Trophies to himself, nor pleasant Discourse to his Friends; but the necessity of the History requires a brief Account to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce better Times and Actions.</p>
            <p>The first Attempt he made, was upon the Castle of <hi>Sterling,</hi> a stately Edifice, and of great Strength; Many times the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> (it being very Capacious) used there to keep their Court and Residence, and in times of Danger to retreat from any Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies; wherein King <hi>James the Sixth</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and First of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> was secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the most part of his younger years, from the turbulency and disquiet of his Subjects, under the Regents, till he took the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment himself. Over the door of the Chappel that belongs to the Castle, this Motto is to be Read, <hi>J. R. nobis haec invicta miserunt centum sex proavi,</hi> 1617. which shews, That it had remained unconquered so many Kings Reigns; but to some mens Genius and Spirit, nothing is unconquerable; for General <hi>Monk,</hi> within Three Days, made the besieged yield up this
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55301:31"/> invincible Piece upon Articles, with all the Warlike Ammunition which was in it, (which was a large proportion) five thousand Arms, forty pieces of Ordnance, all the Records of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Chair and Cloth of State, the Sword, and other rich Furniture of the Kings, sent to the Tower of <hi>London;</hi> and after his Majesties Return, restored to Sir <hi>Archibold Primerose</hi> Clerk Register; with many rich Goods of the Earl of <hi>Marr,</hi> the Hereditary Governor, with the Writings and Deeds belonging to many private persons, which were all re-delivered according to Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Nothing is unconquerable to Valour and Diligence, and neither Bulworks or Rocks, such Fortifications as men of Courage, or Mans-flesh as the General used to call it. So <hi>Edenborough</hi> Castle was called the <hi>Mainden-Castle,</hi> because never Conquered, though twice delivered to the <hi>English;</hi> once in the time of King <hi>James</hi> the Sixth, while the Earl of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> was Regent, being assisted by Sir <hi>Drue Drurie,</hi> by the Command of <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> with Men and great Guns; and also in the time of these Unhappy Wars to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> but chiefly by the Conduct of <hi>General Monk,</hi> who was Lieutenant General of the Ordnance, and chief Engine to take in that Castle. But I have no pleasure to write these things, as he had no delight to remember them, or to act them, but as they were means tending to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55301:32"/> enable him to do the King Service, which was his great intention, as shall be further shewen. An Agent that does not make a good election of right methods, will never make a prosperous Conclusion.</p>
            <p>The next place he attaqued was <hi>Dundee,</hi> whither the Southern <hi>Scots</hi> had conveyed their persons, and most part of their Goods and best Moveables, and all the Wealth of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> and of many other places which were not fortified; so that here was the best Plunder that was gotten in the Wars through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the Three Nations: It being summon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to yield, the Governor <hi>Robert Lumsdaine,</hi> a Gentleman of a brave Spirit, returned An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, <hi>That if the Commander, and the rest of the English Forces, would lay down their Arms, and submit themselves, he would give them Passes to return peaceably to their own Homes;</hi> Which was an arrogant Presumption, an impertinent piece of Gallantry at that time to tender safety to them, that were able to give; and this did much irritate the Besiegers, so that presently they fall to work with the Town; and though it is supposed there were more fighting-men within, than the Enemy without, yet the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55301:32"/> Youth (for he was very young) did use to bring word in what Condition the Town was, That at Nine a Clock the Strangers and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers used to take such large Morning-draughts (whether to make them forget the Misery that their Country was in at that time, or their own personal Troubles and Losses,) that before the Twelfth, they were mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

This story I mention, to shew with what little Engines greatest Designs may be compassed, and that great Captains must make use of the least Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, though they are not to be called little, that tend to their Glory and Triumphs; and further, how pernicious Excess and Riot is to Military Discipline, and a presage of Ruine. The General gave Order for the storm, though a great part of his Forces were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent upon another Occasion, (of which you shall presently hear) a very bold Exploit; but usuall with him first to despise, and then to destroy his Enemy. A Gene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>September</hi> the First, both Horse and Foot fell on, and after a short, but sharp Resistance, he mastered the Town, and in it the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor himself was slain, and some others plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55301:33"/> the Town of all its former and newly deposited Wealth, which amounted to vast Sums; nothing but Plate and Money was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. But see the just Judgment of God, that most of the Wealth being shipped, for to be transported for <hi>Leith</hi> and <hi>England</hi> upon se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Vessels that were taken in the Harbour, (there being sixty of all sorts taken) the Ships were cast away within sight of the Town, and that great Wealth perished without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Storm. The same I have read of the Pillage of the <hi>Swedes</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> which being shipped for transportation into their own Country, in those narrow Seas between <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> were shipwracked: A just Judgment, which teacheth us, That though the Laws of War may approve of those Outrages and Plunderings, yet Divine Justice does not at all allow, but rather Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise them. Now the burthen of Salt returned thither, whence it came; ill got, soon lost; he that is possessed of Plundered and Sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Goods, like <hi>Tholouse</hi> Gold, and <hi>Seius</hi> his Horse, rideth post to Ruine and Poverty. A man may Rob God with a Jeast, but shall be Plagued in Earnest.</p>
            <p>In the time of this Siege, the Committee of Estates and of the Kirk were met together at <hi>Ellit,</hi> in the County of <hi>Perth,</hi> near the High-Lands, with other Lords, Gentlemen, and Ministers, to use their Endeavour to raise the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55301:33"/> Siege of <hi>Dundee,</hi> whither the General dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched <hi>Morgan</hi> and <hi>Alured</hi> with most of his Horse and Dragoons, to surprise them, which was effectually performed. The Souldiers that took them had as good a Market as the other at <hi>Dundee,</hi> many of them getting four hundred or five hundred pounds a piece, and all of them very considerable sums; There were taken the <hi>Earl Marshal,</hi> the <hi>Earl of Craw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> with many of the Nobility, especially the old General <hi>Leshly,</hi> who (some say) was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of a Cubbard there hidden, upon the <hi>English</hi> entring the Town; but they do the Gentleman wrong, for it was a <hi>Dutch</hi> Bed which hath shuts; the best provision that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure place could afford such great Persons. He was one bred from his Child-hood in the <hi>German</hi> Wars, under the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and there acquired great Honour and Riches, and at his Return was imployed by the <hi>Scotch</hi> Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters against <hi>Charles the First;</hi> who at the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification with the <hi>Scots,</hi> forgiving all the rest of his Subjects, was pleased to set a mark of great Grace and Favour upon him, creating him Earl of <hi>Leven;</hi> but with what Gratitude he requited his Majesty, I had rather others should Report. For all Generals were not of the Complexion of our honest General. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides these, there were Mr. <hi>Robert Douglas,</hi> Mr. <hi>Mungo Law,</hi> with the rest of the leading Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, taken and sent by Sea to the Tower of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55301:34"/>
               <hi>London.</hi> After these notable Actions of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Monk,</hi> all <hi>Scotland</hi> readily submitted to the <hi>English,</hi> and all the Towns and strong Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces either voluntarily came in, or submitted upon Summons. When there is no Power to resist, Submission is necessary, the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour will be obeyed; and he that resists against all Hopes and Probabilities, turns a <hi>Desperado,</hi> and as useless as the worst of Cowards.</p>
            <p>These great Successes being acquired with much Pains and Care, the General did contract a long Sicknesse, which held him Prisoner a long time; and though in this Unhappy War he had been very busie in assaulting others, yet it was very hard for him to escape himself, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very near death a long time, and with much difficulty was delivered beyond the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>The <hi>English</hi> pretended Common-wealth having reduced the whole Nation of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> they having a great Calm of Peace and Tranquility, they fall upon a Project (though practised by Usurpers, and Men who had great Fears, because of their great Crimes, and of much Care and Diligence, because of their future Danger to be brought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne Punishment) to Unite all the Three Nations into one Government, and to meet in one Parliament, a Work which they did effect by the present advantages of Conquest, and by a pretended consent of some elected Deputies: This Union being a Work which King <hi>James,</hi> of blessed Memory, set on Foot, and renewed by our Glorious Soveraign, <hi>King</hi> Charles <hi>the Second,</hi> (whom God direct to the Conclusion) an Affair that would as much tend to the Peace and publique Security of all the Three Nations, as any other Designe that can be imagined; But these Men, like the Children of this World, who were more wise in their Generation than the Children of Light and Truth, who were able by their Force then upon those conquered Countries; for so they were then in Appearance, though upon unjust Grounds, they compelled them to send Members to the Parliaments of <hi>England,</hi> which did not a little advantage the Traffick of all, which is since prohibited, but upon a renewed Union would be confirmed; to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55301:35"/> gain this Point they published an Act of Oblivion, to forget all Injuries, and forgive all Hostilities; to imitate the subtil estate of <hi>Athens,</hi> that first gave the President. God hath made us one in many Respects, as Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Language, and Country, being one Island, and happy under one King and Government; now it would be our Sin and Weakness to neglect a perfect Union to all ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses; such a Conjunction will augment the Reputation of both.</p>
            <p>To this end, Commissioners from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Parliament were sent down into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> amongst whom General <hi>Monk</hi> (without whose interposing, little good was to be done in <hi>Scotland;</hi>) and though Saint <hi>John Vane</hi> and <hi>Saloway</hi> with others could talk more, yet none could perswade that Nation so much as he, who (though they looked upon him, in the times of Hostility, as a severe Enemy) yet they trusted him in this business more than all the rest, and upon his giving them hopes of better Dayes; submitted to the present Necessities; (all the Blessings honest men then had, was to expect something better in the future.) Upon setling all things there, according to the Will and Pleasure of their Masters in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> they returned, and General <hi>Monk</hi> with them.</p>
            <p>At this time, some of the Covenanters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either Confederates, or secret Friends,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55301:35"/> with these pretended Common-wealths men, held out with great resolution and boldnesse against these Designes, knowing they had Friends in <hi>England</hi> to make their peace with the greatest there established in Tyranny; but the loyal and honest <hi>Montrossian</hi> Party, who had suffered for his Majesty, and been oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with the greatest Cruelties, not being tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated in the late War with <hi>England</hi> to bear Arms, either to serve their Country, or serve the King; were looked upon with some gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Respect, and by General <hi>Monks</hi> care and patronage, (who then had such a sympathy with Loyalty, that they were trusted as much as any others) and afterwards (being Chief Governor) if he had any Confidence in any, it was in those generous Souls, that had given so great assurance of their Fidelity to the King and his Family. And, for this, I may appeal to the Testimony of all <hi>Scotland,</hi> where, I believe, he will alwayes be had in Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance with honour.</p>
            <p>Scarce were these Transactions concluded, but there began a new business with religious Hypocrites, which must needs be very much apprehended by the <hi>Juncto</hi> at <hi>Westminster</hi> (they begin a War with men of their temper;) A general Assembly convenes in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was such a medly of <hi>Resolutioners</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrators,</hi> terms that need a little explanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (the which we shall briefly interpret.) At
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:55301:36"/> the Battell at <hi>Dunbar, the Kirk</hi> Party was soundly beaten, and then might have learned more Obedience to the King; yet they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued obstinate, so that they would not admit any Persons that had served in Duke <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> Engagement, (for <hi>Montrosses</hi> Party were not to be named, who were doubtless the bravest Souldiers <hi>in that Country,</hi> if the Relator of his Victories hath dealt truly, and might have saved all, had they been entrusted.) Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards there appeared no possible means of saving the Nation, but by imploying all hands; the King sent to the Committee of the Kirk, to desire to know whether such persons as had been in <hi>Hamiltons</hi> Army, upon their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and satisfaction to the <hi>Kirk,</hi> might not be imployed in such a Publique Necessity, when all was in so great a Hazard; the greatest part of the <hi>Committee of the Kirk</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered in the Affirmative, which was so great a Crime esteemed by some of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that they <hi>Remo strated</hi> against this <hi>Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as a ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:55301:36"/> which did much prejudice the Kings Affairs, and give an advantage to the <hi>English</hi> to keep that Country so long in quietness; for what with ballancing these several Interests, and the <hi>Scots</hi> mutual Jealousies, fearing to be trodden down one by the other; they both kept secret Intelligence, and did secret Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the <hi>English,</hi> (there being many of the Layety drawn in to these Factions) that they might both be protected. <hi>Cromwel</hi> encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged most the <hi>Remonstrators,</hi> as being men most agreeing with his Principles; but <hi>Monk</hi> the <hi>Resolutioners,</hi> as being most national and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and such as did hold a secret Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with his Majesty, whom he intended to serve.

            <p>A Lieutenant-Colonell was sent to dismiss this Assembly, which he roundly did, charging them upon the highest Perils not to attempt any such further Meetings, and that therefore not any Three of them should presume to be seen together, which was afterwards done by Colonell <hi>Cobbet</hi> upon another such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention

            <p>Here we may sadly bewail the Errors of some of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Ministers (who, though many of them wanted not Loyalty and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy, yet some were such Time-servers, that they rendred their Profession despicable, and Religion it self (the most excellent signature of Gods Glory in the world) in little Credit, and themselves into the greatest Contempt. Many of them, I doubt not, have lived to give publick Testimony of their Repentance; For doubtless Church-man, while he keeps within the Sphere of his Duty to God and his People, is an Angel of Heaven, but when he shall degenerate from his own Calling, and fall into the Intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues of State and Time-serving, he becomes a Devil; and from a Star in the Firmament of Heaven, he turns a Sooty-Coal in the blackest Hell, and receiveth the greatest Damnation: I must needs confess, that in <hi>Scotland</hi> there was, as I observed in the lit le time I was the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

I have reason to believe, that these men have so experienced the Vanity of contending with Soveraign and Civil Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and have found the Attempt so dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to themselves, that they will study to be quiet, and acknowledge that nothing is more

            <p>Now comes a new Stage, wherein General <hi>Monk</hi> acted a brave part, and that to the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, and his own ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Renown, which was in the <hi>Dutch</hi> War: The occasion of this War, was that which is cause of all, Covetousness and Ambition; The <hi>English</hi> States-men thought scorn, that they profered Alliance was slighted, their Agent <hi>Dorislaw</hi> assassinated, and their extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Embassadors affronted; all was pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently endured, till they had cleared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves at Home of all Opposition; then they Resolve to call them to an Accompt, and as a Preface to the War, comes out that Act, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t tuled, <hi>For the encouragement of Navigation,</hi> wherein they prohibited the importing of any Foreign Commodities (except upon <hi>English</hi> Bottoms) or such as were of the Growth of the Country whence the Commodities came: This was an Allarm sufficient to the <hi>Dutch;</hi> and the <hi>English</hi> Merchants (earnest for the War) complained much, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grossed all the Trade to the East <hi>Indies</hi> and to <hi>Guiney,</hi> most of it to the <hi>Levant,</hi> and the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea; that they had faln into the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture of Cloth, and spoyled their Marts at
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55301:38"/>
               <hi>Hamborough</hi> and at <hi>Dort,</hi> and that they were grown exceeding Poor, and the other very Rich: Much of this was too true, yet this was not to be imputed to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> so much as to the <hi>English</hi> Merchants want of Industry and Frugality. For our Merchants, as soon as they can clear ten Thousand Pounds, they must have their Country-Houses as well as their City-Houses, and Coaches, and live in as great state as Gentlemen of twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds <hi>per annum;</hi> and, out of Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, did use to make Purchases of Land too soon, and thereby disenable themselves to carry on a great Trade; whereas the <hi>Dutch</hi> do live thriftily, and though men of great stocks, still keep to their Imployments, which doth much advance their Traffick; and their Corporations or Companies for Trade, being very just, encouraged all to be Adventurers; too much of this was too true, and often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by the General. I hope my Country-men will not be offended at this direction for good Husbandry; for there is no malice in the Case. Our great Complaint is Poverty, and want of Trade, when all is occasioned by our own Prodigality; and expecting more Profit than the Nation can afford, many Gleaners cannot all gather their Load.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> were willing to decline this storm from <hi>England,</hi> and to that end, sent over an Embassy by <hi>Myn Heer Joachim,</hi> but that was
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55301:39"/> fruitless; Afterwards they sent four Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, <hi>viz. Myn Heeren Catz. Van de Peere, Schaep</hi> and <hi>Newport,</hi> to shew their great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, and to give the greater Authority; but these were accosted with such high Demands about the Herring-fishing, the business of <hi>Amboyna,</hi> and a Free Trade in the <hi>Schelde</hi> from <hi>Middleburgh</hi> to <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> with satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the Damages of their Merchants, which moved the passion of these United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, that they should be domineered over by these upstart Common-wealths men, who had murthered their own Soveraign, and the best of Kings, at his own Palace Gate. And from hence begins a most furious and bloody War, wherein General <hi>Monk</hi> bore a great part; but in the beginning he was not in Commission, so that we will not attribute the great Actions of others to him; He has Glory enough of his own, he shall not need to Rob others: For to <hi>General Blague</hi> was due the Glory of the Conduct of the first part of the War, a Person (that whatsoever he was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise) deserves to be named with Honour, who by his Actions in this <hi>Dutch</hi> War, and at <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers, Tunis</hi> and <hi>Sancta Cruz,</hi> hath made the <hi>English</hi> Courage to be both <hi>Remembred</hi> and <hi>Admired</hi> amongst all our Neighbour Nations, (if we do not teach them to forget it by the Cowardice and Idleness of our Times) who, though <hi>Van Trump</hi> as he conveyed the <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:55301:39"/> Fleet through our Channel, and set up a Broom at the Poope of his Ship, threatned to sweep the Narrow Seas; yet upon his Return, <hi>Blague</hi> speeding out a competent Fleet, made him leave much of his Broom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and gathered up many Men of War and Merchants. Diligence and Activity does procure Success, as much as Courage and great Hazard; to begin a Design in time, is in a manner to finish it.</p>
            <p>In the heat of this war, General <hi>Monk</hi> is made one of the Commissioners for Sea-Service (there being Three in all) against <hi>Olivers</hi> will, who would have had another, and is to try his Skill by VVater, a new Trade for an old Commander to learn; yet his Courage and Successes did not forsake him, but he hastens away to this Employment; and that was his constant practice, to embrace Danger▪ and not to fly from it, as appeated in the heat of the Fight, when one Evening, it beginning to grow duskish, the Masters advised him not to stand to them again that Night, for fear of the Fire-Ships; He answered with Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>The very Powder of the Guns of this Ship is able to blow a Fire-Ship from it,</hi> and so they charged through again; and at times, when the Sea-men, according to their terms of Art, cryed <hi>Starboard</hi> and <hi>Larboard,</hi> he alwayes cryed <hi>Ay Boyes, Let us board them.</hi> Some who are apter to quarrel with mens Vertues, than
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55301:40"/> their Vices, do hisse at this great Courage; but who can, that hath a grain of wisdom, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride a Souldier for his Value. <hi>Caesar</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes used to say, <hi>Come Boyes,</hi> and go in the Head himself, and not bid them go without him; but for his pains, he may be called a rash, bruitish, and bafled Fellow in this Age of Worthies.</p>
            <p>General <hi>Monk,</hi> who by his great and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Conduct, in many Battells had approved himself one of the greatest Land Captains of this Age, did shew he was no less capable of making himself successful at Sea. For the first of these, after the first Encounter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in General <hi>Deane</hi> was slain, was chiefly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged by him; and the latter, which was the most important and cruel of the two, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his sole Conduct: But because they were both of them of so extraordinary advantage to the Reputation of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, we shall be a little more than usually particular in the relation of them, but yet with just and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial respect to the truth of the whole Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>The first Fight was upon the Second day of <hi>June,</hi> 1653. The <hi>English</hi> Fleet was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Generals, <hi>Monk</hi> and <hi>Deane,</hi> both together in one Ship; <hi>Pen</hi> was Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, and <hi>Lawson</hi> Rear-Admiral: The <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet was commanded by <hi>Van Trump</hi> in chief, whose principal Commanders under him were
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55301:40"/> the two <hi>Eversons, De Witt</hi> &amp; <hi>Rutier,</hi> all of them very stout and expert Sea-men. The <hi>Dutch</hi> were far more in number than the <hi>English,</hi> who expected an accession of Ships by Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Blague,</hi> but he could not get up timely enough to them. The Battel began very early in the morning, and at the first shot made by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> General <hi>Deane</hi> was slain, who was no sooner dead, but General <hi>Monk</hi> took his Cloak and covered him, commanding the Sea-men to mind their business. At ten of the Clock, the Fight began to be very sharp, and chiefly, between the two Squadrons, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>Lawson</hi> and <hi>De Ruiter; Van Trump</hi> came in to relieve the last, and General <hi>Monk</hi> with the grosse of the Fleet (which came on in excellent Order) engaged him. The Fight continued very hot till three in the Afternoon, and <hi>Lawson</hi> sunk a Ship of Helm of forty two Guns, who had in her One hundred and forty eight men, and many other were slain and wounded; and much more execution had been done, but that the Wind blew very cross to the <hi>English,</hi> and so favoured the <hi>Dutch,</hi> that they bore away before it, and were follow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d by some of the best <hi>English</hi> Saylors whilst there was any light.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Dean,</hi> the night before he was killed, the Rats had torn and devoured all that part of his Doubtlet, on the left-side, where he was killed with a Canon Bullet, and his own
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:55301:41"/> spirit was much sensible of his approaching Fate. For he was a <hi>Beemist</hi> in Religion, yet he retired for two hours to some private De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions (which was not usual with him) the morning before his death, and those that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served him then, (he being known to be vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant enough) there appeared, as it were, death in his Face; and a great Lady in <hi>Scotland</hi> (while he commanded there) that addressed to him for some business, foretold his death by the skill of the <hi>Second fight:</hi> Of this I make no reflection, but that there are some good Spirits that watch for us, and warn us.</p>
            <p>The next morning, very early, General <hi>Monk</hi> found himself near the Enemy, but the Wind being slack, it was Noon before the Fleets engaged; which was continued with much more vigour than at any time before, and lasted till ten at Night. Ninety of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, at the heat of the Engagement, were in so great Confusion, and unwilling to stand to the Fight, that <hi>Van Trump</hi> fired upon them, and sent his own Boat to Command them to come up to him; nevertheless he could not get above twenty of them to return, the rest steered away East and by South; but the Wind being very fresh westwardly, <hi>Monk</hi> pressed so hard upon them, that he sunk six of their best Ships, and two of the others were blown up amongst their own Fleet. Eleven Ships were taken, and two Hoyes, and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55301:41"/> hundred and fifty Prisoners, whereof six were Captains of good Note; and if they had not got upon the Flats by <hi>Dunkirk</hi> and <hi>Calice,</hi> whereby our great Ships could not get up to them, most of their Fleet had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived or taken; <hi>Van Trump</hi> got of sixty five Sayl of Ships: The <hi>English</hi> had not one Ship either lost or disabled; and except General <hi>Deane,</hi> but one Captain slain, and about One hundred and fifty Common men, and twenty four hurt. Victory is seldom without Blood, and the most Warlike Gamesters cannot alwayes prove Winners without some losse.</p>
            <p>After this Defeat, the <hi>Dutch</hi> were very desirous to regain their Reputation, and, in order thereunto, they equipped a very great Fleet, to the number of One hundred twenty five Sayl, with so much confidence of Success, that they posted <hi>Van Trump</hi> out with Ninety five, before the rest were ready, which were to be brought to him by <hi>De Witt</hi> from the <hi>Texel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was upon the Twentieth day of <hi>July</hi> in the morning, when the <hi>English</hi> Fleet consisting of about One hundred Ships, discryed the <hi>Dutch,</hi> they had time to draw together; but the <hi>English</hi> were all a-stern, and could not get up, till six of the Clock, to come to any En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement. And then it was begun, but with a few of the nimblest Frigats, which were
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:55301:42"/> afterwards inforced to the number of thirty, who continued the Battel till the Night part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, though the rest of the Fleet could not get up to joyn with them. The <hi>English</hi> never use to decline an Enemy, though under the greatest Disadvantages.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch,</hi> by the darkness of the night, sent away many of their maimed disabled Ships, and got by the <hi>English</hi> Fleet, to joyn with the twenty five Ships that <hi>De Witt</hi> brought to them, which encouraged the rest to renew the Fight, in hopes to be revenged of their late affront. And now both Fleets met in the most fierce and cruel Fight that ever was fought. The <hi>English</hi> had neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lived with the <hi>Dutch</hi> to the time of this War, and suffered them to lord it over other Nations at Sea, and were now forced to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute hard for that Dominion.</p>
            <p>General <hi>Monck</hi> observing this Engagement to be very burthensome, Orders all his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains neither to give nor take Quarter; For he had found by Experience, That the taking of Ships, obliged him alwayes to send off other Ships with them, and so the Fleet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came weakened: The Ayr was quickly filled with scattered Limbs of men blown up; the Sea was dyed with the Blood that flowed from the Veins of the Slain and Wounded: <hi>De Witt</hi> and <hi>De Ruiter</hi> did bestir themselves, and often attempted to Board the Ship in
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55301:42"/> which the General himself was; <hi>Cornelius Eversons</hi> Ship was sunk; and the famous <hi>Van Trump</hi> himself standing upon the Poope of his Ship, with his drawn Sword, encouraging his men, was slain with a Musket-Bullet; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the rest of the Fleet was so discouraged, that they hoysted out all the Sayl they could, to hasten away towards the <hi>Texel.</hi> I had a desire to have had a more particular account from an Officer that was signal in that Service, take his Answer in his own words.</p>

                        <p>YOURS of the <hi>24<seg rend="sup">th</seg>.</hi> Instant came to my Hands the <hi>21<seg rend="sup">st</seg>.</hi> at which time I was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry infirm, by reason of a great Cold, pain in my Head with an Imposthume, and my Journal in the late great Fire of <hi>London</hi> burnt or scattered, and those of the latest not in my Hands, all which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled me, doing that which you, &amp;c. may expect in honour of that my Noble Gentleman deceased, for whom, though I was not remembred, yet could not forget to pay my last Duty.</p>
                        <p>In the <hi>Flanders</hi> Battell, so call'd, because fought on that Coast, <hi>Van Trump,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> General, a person of great Courage and Conduct, more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Ships than We; the Battell began betimes, with the left Wing of our Fleet, <hi>Lawson</hi> Admiral of the Blew Squadron, <hi>Jordan</hi> Vice-Admiral, <hi>Goodson</hi> Rear-Admiral, which Three passed
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:55301:43"/> through (being left by their Squadron about forty Sayl) the whole <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet; General <hi>Monck</hi> and <hi>Deane</hi> very passionate to come to our Relief, in which Conflict General <hi>Deane</hi> was slain, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near to General <hi>Monck;</hi> to whom the whole Conduct of the Fleet is left, by whose Prudence and Valour, the next day the Victory was obtained.</p>
                        <p>At Sun-rising the General calls his Flag-Officers to Council, tells them sad News of his Partner Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Deanes</hi> death, encouraging them to double Valour and Duty, whose Inclinations and Promises were faithful to him, and whose Advice and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel the General desired, which concluded by their Consents, should be put in Execution immediately, and as binding (as he said) to him as an Act of Parliament; It was then determined, by reason di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the blew Squadron had shew'd too much timorosi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55301:43"/> succour them, according to Order, as their boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Duty, they might go Home if they durst, and tell their Superiours, our Wives and Children, where they left their General, &amp;c.

                        <p>MY Journal of those Battels lost, yet I well remember, after the Battel of <hi>Flanders,</hi> which I gave you an account of in my last.</p>
                        <p>The General (with his Council) determined to send all the wounded and sick men for several Ports in <hi>England,</hi> also the disabled Ships, that they might be repair'd, and hastn'd to the General again, whilst he with the rest of the Fleet plyed on the Coast
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:55301:44"/> of <hi>Holland,</hi> sometimes of the <hi>Texel</hi> and <hi>Ulye,</hi> &amp;c. as well to prevent Trade, as to let the <hi>Dutch</hi> Nation know their Fleet was beaten, in which they were too apt to be deceived, and their Admiral, &amp;c. To make Lyes their Refuge, that our Fleet was still worsted.</p>
                        <p>The General, &amp;c. abiding on their Coast, took several Prizes, and exercised the greatest Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, to prevent a Conjunction of that part of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, which was making ready of their greatest Ships in the <hi>Texel</hi> and <hi>Ulye,</hi> with those at the <hi>Weelings;</hi> but all Endeavors could not hinder the same, their own People (by their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, seeing Us still on their Coast) forc'd them forth; a storm of Wind right on their Shore, when not above a League off, took Us, which put more Fear and Perplexity into the Commanders and Mariners, then all their Forces could do. Our Prayers were to the Almighty to free Us from that Danger, that We might get off their Shore, and Fight like Men.</p>
                        <p>About the last of <hi>July</hi> (praised be God) he gave us a small gaile, to carry us off from their Shore; taking the opportunity thereof, 'twas the thoughts of most of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Commanders that we fled, and would not give Battel; but <hi>Van Trump</hi> the Admiral was not of that Opinion, Answering, <hi>That we were</hi> English-<hi>men, and did not lay upon their Coast so long, to dare them to come forth, and now to run away;</hi> But said, <hi>It was to get off their Shore, to have Sea-room to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55301:44"/> Fight</hi> (which he truly interpreted); and charg'd his Commanders to be in all readiness the next day, which was the Lords-Day, that we would give them Battel.</p>
                        <p>The General (whom Dangers could never daunt) at the Sun-rising (with the rest in Order) tackt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Enemy, who nearly pursued, having consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Order of Fighting, &amp;c. The day before, their Fleet consisted of about <hi>140</hi> Sayl, all the strength then <hi>Holland</hi> could make; they were fresh, and fully man'd; they had the Wind of us, and on their Coast (all advantages possible); Our Fleet about <hi>90</hi> Sayl, having received some Recruits from <hi>England,</hi> but many of our men sick of the Scurvy, wanting of our numbers, &amp;c. But our God, the Strength of those that trust in him, gave Courage and Resolution to the General, and the rest, to go on Valiantly.</p>
                        <p>The Enemy had Fire-Ships (we none) which put the Fleet in some trouble, and having the Wind of us, one of their Fire-Ships set the St. <hi>Andrew</hi> on Fire, (others were in danger) which caus'd some of her Men desert her; the Captain, with the rest, by their Courage, put it out again, and when all their Fire-Ships were spent, we rejoyc'd, and Fought them (as we thought) on equal terms, every Commander observing their Orders in a line, to assist each other as much as could be (a very orderly Battel) on both sides: Six Passes we had, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who had the best, till about two or three After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon. <hi>Van Trump</hi> their Admiral bore large
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55301:45"/> away from us to their own Coast, in sight thereof, assisted by some of their Flags and others. Our General and the rest pursued, took and fired divers of them, and gained, God be ever praised, a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Victory; insomuch that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Captains and others said, <hi>That the Hand of God Fought against them, and now they would have Peace;</hi> Van Trump their Admiral was slain in this Battel with a small Shot.</p>

            </q>
            <p>Thus far you have an Account from a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Flag-Officer.</p>
            <p>The <hi>English</hi> pursued little, having bought the Victory at a dear Rate, but tacked about to Sole Bay, there to Repair the scattered Ships, and dispose of their Prisoners, which were about twelve hundred men, taken out of Boats, and swimming in the Sea. Thirty three Sayl of Ships (out of which, by the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the <hi>English,</hi> they were saved) were sunk to the bottom of the Sea, in regard that these Prisoners were belonging to so many lost Ships, by this means the number of them was known; but it is supposed some were sunk, out of which no Men were saved. The <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> lost four hundred Common men, and eight Captains, <hi>viz. Graves, Peacock, Taylor, Crispe, Newman, Cox, Owen</hi> and <hi>Chapman,</hi> men of great Resolution; and had about seven hundred wounded, whereof five were Commanders, but they lost only one Ship, which was called the <hi>Oak,</hi> and presently General <hi>Monck</hi> dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55301:45"/> his Prisoners, takes in Provisions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to ply upon the <hi>Dutch</hi> Coasts. And let those <hi>Hogen Mogens</hi> know, that the <hi>English,</hi> when they pleased, could be their Masters; and that it was by Sufferance, not Right, that they had domineered so long.</p>
            <p>Thus you see how great <hi>Van Trump,</hi> one of the best Officers that this Age hath produced, being bred in Sea-Fights and Voyages from a Child, experienced as well as stout, yet is forced to fall before the Fortunate and Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Genius of <hi>General Monck,</hi> who was but a Novice in these kind of Services. One can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but take notice of the Prodigious Actions of this War, wherein all the Engins and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of Death were set at Work, for the destruction of the one Party by the other. And what continued Fights there were, sometimes for several dayes together, the Sea-men stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the face of Death, dressed up with the greatest terribleness. And the great Ships, like so many Citadels, gunned and manned to that vast degree, that former Ages have never seen from <hi>Noahs</hi> dayes, who is supposed to have built the first Ship, in the divine project of the Ark, for the saving of a Seed to continue the World, though it may be questioned: For what shall we say then to those Authors, that do by good probable conjecture affirm, That immediately before the Flood, there were more of the Posterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> than in
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55301:46"/> this Age we live in, which how they could disperse about the habitable parts of the World, would be hard to Resolve, without denying all Islands to be before the Flood: But to leave this, we may safely assert, That there never was such Sea-Fights, as between these powerful Nations. Those anciently between the <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Grecians,</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> or between <hi>Augustus</hi> and <hi>Mark Anthony;</hi> they were but flying and running Skirmishes, in comparison of these Battels; nay, that so celebrated between the whole Force of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> with the <hi>Turks</hi> at <hi>Lepanto,</hi> was but an easie Warfare, if we look but upon the least of these bloody Fights. <hi>Belgium Gloriosum</hi> that boasts so much, will remember these Victories of the <hi>English</hi> with no great content; for they were above the hopes of their Friends, and beyond the expectation of all the World: Who had forgot that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fishermen had learned first to Fight of the Sea-men of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many things are supposed to have very much conduced to the happy administration of that War; one was, the great Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Rewards given to the Officers and Sea-men; The Wives of many of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, who had been slain in the Service, having four or five hundred Pounds given them and their Children, to provide for them: And all that survived, had <hi>Medals,</hi> and some
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:55301:46"/> of the Chief, <hi>Chains</hi> of Gold, with other good Gratuities; and truly, were it not pitty, a man that hazards his Life for the Safety and Riches of others, should want wherewithall to feed himself, and maintain his own Life; and if he escapes the danger, he should be enabled for the future to live in some measure comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly himself. Some have observed, that many Officers of the late Usurped Powers, when they got Lands and Riches, began to remit of their Courage, and were unwilling to hazard more; like the diseased Souldier of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> when he was cured, and think that poverty and want is a fit qualification for a fighting-man; this is to make Valour an Hungry, and jejune Vertue, and only in order to fill mens Bellies; but undoubtedly Rewards never lessened Vertue, where it was not forced and counterfeit.</p>
            <p>And their Bounty was not confined to the Officers alone, but to all the Sea-men, besides constant pay, which they received on Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board before dismission, and other little Vailes out of Prizes (which was lading above Deck); they had also Tun and Gun money for all Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes, of which they would not abate a penny, as you shall hear afterwards. But we must needs complain of the Barrenness of this Age of Virtue, that men will not so willingly do their Duties, without the base Reward of Money; we must forgive vulgar Souls, that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:55301:47"/> love vulgar Encouragements; and though Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry be welcome to a Rich man, yet the Poor cannot feed upon it. What men need, that they most prize; and he that wants Bread, doth not regard Titles: Honour is a Feather to be worn with Festival Clothes, he that is Naked would exchange it for a Vest to keep him warm.</p>
            <p>That which confirms my Observation, is a story I have heard; that in the late Unhappy Wars in <hi>England,</hi> a poor Fellow comes a great way to <hi>London,</hi> and attends upon the <hi>Committee of Denby</hi>-House, and there tendered himself as one that had matter of great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to Communicate, who, after some days of Attendance, by his continual Application, He was asked, <hi>What the Matters were that he had to Propose,</hi> He told them, <hi>There was such a considerable Garrison in the West, which he could deliver up to them;</hi> They objecting the impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility of such a Design, told him how incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable a person he was; yet he further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained himself, That if they would gratifie his wife &amp; Children with such a sum of mony, that he used to carry in many Goods into the Stores, and remove them upon any occasion, so that he would blow up all their Ammunition and Stores, and then they would upon the first appearance of their Forces be sure to carry it: They Replyed, why then your self will be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly destroyed in the performance; No mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55301:47"/> answers this Fellow, let my Wife and Children have the Reward. This was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted or regarded, but thus proposed; which shews, what great Motives Money rewards are to mean persons. All Ages have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of the cogent power of Gold, that it doth not encourage Vertue so much as Vice; Men dig to Hell, to find a <hi>Viaticum</hi> to carry them thither; but I think never was more reason than now, for Gold is the God of this present World.</p>
            <p>About the sixteenth of <hi>April,</hi> 1653. <hi>Cromwel</hi> longing to be in the Throne, was ready to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss the pretended Parliament, but the Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of these Members of the <hi>Juncto</hi> to General <hi>Monck</hi> (for the glorious Actions that he had done, gave <hi>Cromwel</hi> some jealousie, that they might have confidence in him to appear for them, or at least to give him (their aspiring General) some ballance) they pretended a great interest in him, but upon discourse with him, he soon satisfied <hi>Cromwel,</hi> that he had no Concern for them, nor any Obligation to them; so early durst not <hi>Cromwel</hi> thrust the Rump out of Doors, till he were assured that the General was satisfied in it; and then on the twentieth of <hi>April,</hi> they were jeared out of the House. After many years Tyranny, to the no little joy of the People, who are seldom sorry for the Ruines and Downfal of those that unjustly oppress them. This Meteor of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:55301:48"/> Usurped Power shone in the World as if it had been a fixed Star, but when faln, it was discovered to be a base slimy Earth, fit to be trodden under foot.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cromwel</hi> thought it now high time to speed himself into the Possession of his long looked for Ayms, and that he might go up to the Throne with more peace and satisfaction to the Common People, he makes a sudden Peace with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and betrayeth all the advantages of the War, that had cost these Nations so much Blood and Treasure, which the General did often highly resent, as a base Treachery in him; For certain it is, they could not have Fought above one Battel more, and then our Fleets were blocking up their River, so that before the end of that year, the <hi>English</hi> might have given what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions they pleased; but God hath otherwise disposed, and we must submit to his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which is our best Inheritance. When we Carve for our selves, we either cut our Fingers, or else feed upon that which gives a surfeit.</p>
            <p>After the end of the War, the General did take great Care, that all those that had ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured their Lives freely, should be rewarded justly; so that the wounded Men, the Widows and Orphans, had liberal Pensions out of the Chamber of <hi>Chatham;</hi> and being at the Navy-Office one Morning, some thousands of Sea-men
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:55301:48"/> came to demand their Tun and Gun Money, which did arise to a great sum (for fifteen hundred Ships, of all sorts, great and little, were taken); but the Money could not be advanced upon the concluding of the Peace, but they must give some time for sell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the Prizes; and thus the General infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them, which seemed at present to satisfie them. But the General coming to <hi>Whitehall</hi> to give <hi>Oliver</hi> an Accompt of some Matters, and of the Sea-mens just Demands; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing present with him, News is brought, that three or four thousand Sea-men were come as far as <hi>Charing-Cross</hi> with Swords, Pistols and Clubs; General <hi>Monck</hi> runs down to meet them (because he thought himself wronged, who had undertaken the care of their Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and had but that Morning assured them of due Payment, and they were all fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with his word,) coming down, he draws his Sword, &amp; falls upon them, and <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> follows with one or two Attendants: The General cuts and hews the Sea-men, and drives them before him; here you may see a strange boldness, and perhaps, an act of as high Resolution, as is to be found in ancient story; that a single man, only with his Sword, should drive such great numbers of <hi>English</hi> Sea-men, who are those that want neither Boldness or Courage, and are a sort of Mankind, that by frequent Conversation with Death and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:55301:49"/> are fearless, and ready to attempt at any thing, though never so desperate: But the Generals good Conduct and Vertue was so well known, that they presently dispersed, many of them having first received due Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement from his Sword. Amongst this Croud and Rabble, it seems, there was one who was about his lawful Occasions, and the Generals Sword lighting upon his Nose, he gave him in satisfaction 10 pounds afterwards, with this Expostulation <hi>(What did a Jack-Daw do amongst Rookes.)</hi> Some men that Railly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all that is brave, when they cannot gainsay a Courage, then they question a Prudence; as if a great Heart and Head were too much for one Body, because they want both the one and the other.</p>
            <p>And afterwards this Gun and Tun-Money was duely paid, upon the earnest sollicitation of the General, who knew that they had earned it bravely; and alwayes accompted it the greatest Oppression to Rob Poor Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of their Pay, which is the price of their Blood; and therefore it was a Law in his Articles of War, That all Officers that did detain the Pay of any Souldiers, without Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from the General or Chief Officer, should be Casheired; and many did experiment this Justice, and that deservedly. 'Tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that Kingdoms or Armies can subsist, unlesse every one hath his due; If the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:55301:49"/> will have all the Pay, they must receive all the Wounds, and find few to follow them.</p>
            <p>After all his Pains in this Bloody-War (the little <hi>Juncto,</hi> chosen by the Army, had upon their last Victories against the <hi>Dutch,</hi> ordered him a Chain of Gold, with a large Meddal append<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with the representation of a Sea Fight,) <hi>Cromwel</hi> invited him to Dinner, and put it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self about his Neck, and made him wear it all Dinner-time; and thus the Usurper thinks he had him chained to his Service. Gold hath a magnetique Vertue, when it is liberally bestowed; it is seldom Seed without a good Harvest, and he that hath it, and doth not use it in the way of Bounty, must take care he doth not need men twice.</p>
            <p>And now he hath hopes of some little time to rest himself, &amp; visit his Friends, but his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was disappointed (for his Life must be nothing but Business and Action;) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are forced to omit many great Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which in another man would be of great Remark, but with him but ordinary, and, as it were, his daily and familiar practice. Vertue, when it is setled in an habit, renders great Actions easie, and without difficulty; Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry seldom leaves those with whom it is grown Familiar.</p>
            <p>The Kings faithful Friends and Subjects (having the unhappinesse to be defeated in
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55301:50"/> many Enterprizes for his Restauration) being of an unwearied and invincible Loyalty; though they could not Conquer, yet they could Dye for him, and to that end continued their practices in the Three Nations, where many Loyal persons, under the barbarous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Law and Justice, were murthered in defence of his Majesties Right and Title: But in <hi>Scotland,</hi> by the Power and Credit of the Earl of <hi>Glencarn, Athole, Seaforth, Kincoole;</hi> with others, who endeavouring to Unite their Forces, (which were no contemptible number) <hi>Glencarnes</hi> being singly about four thousand, though not very well armed or provided) yet did think themselves sufficient to encounter with the <hi>English</hi> then in <hi>Scotland;</hi> but some of them being defeated before they could come to a general Rendezvous, did somewhat dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them. A Check in the beginning of an Undertaking is very dangerous, if not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a Break-Neck to future Success; a Fright disorders a great Army.</p>
            <p>The arrival of <hi>Middleton,</hi> with some Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies out of <hi>Holland,</hi> with Commission to be General, and Sir <hi>George Monroe</hi> Lieutenant-General, with the Lord <hi>Napier,</hi> and Major-General <hi>Daliel,</hi> at first did seem much to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and animate the High-land Levies; but this Assistance did soon ruine the whole De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe. For the great Noble-men, by whose Credit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd Influence this Work was begun,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:55301:50"/> thought scorn to submit to the Command of such, whom they judged their Inferiours, and with-drew themselves, and a great part of their Souldiers, Resolving to manage the Kings business severally, to the Ruine of all in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. This was not the first time that Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Emulation had injured the Kings Affairs, and occasioned the ruine of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. One would think, that in such a time of publique Distress and Calamity, no matter who Commanded, so that the Kings Businesse was well performed, and Himself and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects delivered; but 'tis impossible to find Courts and Camps without Jealousies and Envies, which too often have introduced Ruine into both: Which might be eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by many instances in these late Times; our Ruine is more advanced by those about us, than the Enemy that is against us; Division at Home is worse than an Invader.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cromwel,</hi> whose Crimes and Fears kept him very diligent, and not liking such a Cloud in the North, that might soon over-spread the Three Kingdoms, finding the Winds high, and the Discontents very great in all parts of his pretended Government, thinks <hi>Lilborne,</hi> then Commander in Chief in <hi>Scotland,</hi> a man not of any Conduct, and unqualified for such a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; some offer at <hi>Disborough,</hi> but <hi>Cromwel</hi> knew his greatest Commendation was, that he was his Brother-in-Law, and a man that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:55301:51"/> could bluster high at Committees, and in <hi>White-hall;</hi> but the Mountains and High-lands of <hi>Scotland</hi> would soon have put him out of breath; he did judge that he had neither Courage nor Skill for such an Expedition, yet, some say, it was Resolved on purpose to keep General <hi>Monck</hi> out of Command; when <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> designed General <hi>Monck</hi> thither, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd also the most Mutinous and Seditious part of his Forces, that were dissatisfied with his Government, that they might watch their General, and he have a jealous Eye upon them; an instance, that this Impostor did not want his Arts. This was without great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, but because he could regulate them best with such a Counterpoise; the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litician is jealous, though without cause.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lambert</hi> was grown too great for the <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> Command, he must lord it in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> which <hi>Cromwels</hi> jealousie will not long endure, so that General <hi>Monck</hi> must into <hi>Scotland</hi> again; for the Enemy there was rendred very formidable by <hi>Lilborn,</hi> who durst not stir out of his Quarters for fear of several flying Parties that ran up and down in the Low-lands, so the General made what hast possible, and being arrived made presently a great Change in the Country: First, he looks to his own Forces, which were very zealous in Disputes of Religion one with the other; many violent Anabaptists being admitted into
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55301:51"/> the Army by the favour and intercession of <hi>Lilborn,</hi> who was inclined to those Opinions; but he silenced these Heats and Quarrels, and discountenanced the Sectary Party in the Army; the Confidents and Persons whom he most favoured and trusted, were of generous and free Principles, which made many of the other secretly complain, that he did not favour the Godly and Praying-Party, (for such they esteemed themselves) though many of them of as oppressing and false Principles as any men in the World; having ordered many Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters both at <hi>Leith</hi> and <hi>Edenborough,</hi> he begins his March into the High-lands. He had not his Materials to prepare, when he was to go to his Work, and made good Provision, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he entred into Action; a wise General thinks before he acts.</p>
            <p>And commissionating Major-General <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> with that part of the <hi>English</hi> Forces that were quartered about <hi>Aberdene,</hi> they both se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral wayes go in search of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Forces, and spend a great part of the Summer in those untrodden Mountains and Boggs, making such a March over all the H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gh-lands, that the <hi>Scots</hi> themselves had it in admiration; and may seem to exceed the Marches of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned <hi>Montrosse,</hi> because his Followers were most of them <hi>Highlanders,</hi> in their own Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Nest, where they were born and had alwayes lived. But the General with
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55301:52"/> his Southern men (that came from the warmest parts of <hi>England</hi>) did so over-match them, that they could get neither Rest, nor time to Eat; and <hi>July</hi> the 20<seg rend="sup">th</seg>. 1654. at <hi>Loughgerry Middleton</hi> was Routed, and totally defeated by that part of the Army under Colonell <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.</hi> A flying Enemy that avoids fighting to over-take, is to over-come them, if a wary Captain, that is not secure, hath them in the Chace.</p>
            <p>The General did take great Care for Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions for his Forces, which was carried upon Baggage-Horses, forty sometimes of them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ost in a Morning in a Bogg, and at several Stages he had laid up store of Bisket and Cheese, that with no inconvenience his March might be hindred. He over-ran the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of those that were in Arms, and now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Harvest desolated all that they had sown, and destroyed their Habitations, that at Winter they must starve, or else submit; and by this Obligation, kept several parts of the Country of the <hi>Highlanders</hi> in such Awe, and made them pay their Assessments duly, though there was but once a year any entrance into their Country. Some Countries, like strong Forts, to Conquer them, you must first starve them; and it is better to pinch their Bellies, than to shed their Blood.</p>
            <p>He planted several Garrisons, one especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the chief House of the Lord <hi>Arguile</hi> at
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55301:52"/>
               <hi>Innerary,</hi> and many other places; being in his March, he was received into a Lairds House, one of the <hi>Campbells</hi> of <hi>Glenarchie,</hi> where he liking the scitua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion for a Garrison, and for a store of Provisions and Ammunition, which the Gentleman was unwilling to consent to, so that he himself freely commanded all his Officers to with-draw out of the House; For he told him, <hi>He would not violate Hospitality, but he must try whether he could take it by Force;</hi> And advised him, <hi>To look to the Defence, and to draw up his Forces. Glenarchie</hi> had many of his Name and Friends about him, which consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting together, thought fitter upon some Conditions, for reservation of the best part of the House for their own use, and at last consented to yield it. In times of War and Necessity, a General must not Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment away his own and Armies safety; a good occasion is alwayes to be taken fast hold off.</p>
            <p>He planted a great Force in the remotest Western High-lands in <hi>Leoquaber,</hi> where al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes were eight or nine Companies of Foot, and because of the unhealthiness of the place, they were exchanged every year in Summer-time, else it had been impossible ever to have marched thither by these Garrisons, and some others; with the Reputation of his March about these untrodden places (I mean by an Army) which the <hi>Scots</hi> themselves never
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55301:53"/> thought could be penetrated by the <hi>English;</hi> He did so far Awe the <hi>Highlanders,</hi> that they durst not so much as steal a Cow; nay, in the most theevish part of the Country, if there were any Horse strayed, they would Cry him; and to secure his Army <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hrough these Straits, he alwayes had two Wings, of a competent force, which flanked his Army, and marched at some distance somewhat before the Body. Prevention of Surprisal, and sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Infals in such places, was a certain means of security; in an Enemies Country we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be too careful.</p>
            <p>He was alwayes at his Quarters about Noon, or before, and made small Marches, so that six miles was a great Journey some days, when the Wayes were so bad, that many a Trooper lost his Horse amongst those steepy Precipices, and was forced to turn Foot-man. He alwayes took the Ground himself, where he would encamp, and rode about and placed Guards at such Avenues, that the Souldiers thought themselves safe as in a Garrison; His Judgment and Experience was so great in lodging them; he kept in this March his Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence upon the Enemy himself, &amp; had many <hi>Highlanders</hi> that brought him an Accompt of the Necessities of the Enemy. His custom was, after Guards were placed, to fall upon his cold Meat, (of which he had store dressed the Night before) and upon the Grass in the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55301:53"/> midst of his Officers, and throw them Joynts of Meat very bountifully; and at Nights there was great Provisions of all kind of Meat that could be got, and free welcome to all the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, with better state in his Tent, and great preparations made for the next days Dinner: He took Care for the Lodging and Feeding of his Souldiers, as a Father would do of his Children, and would play the Physitian him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self oftentimes, having many Receipts for them. He that does not keep his Souldiers in Health, shall find but weak Hearts and Hands when he comes to need them; 'tis pitty Men of Courage should ever want Necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
            <p>After the submission of all the Chief, he returns to <hi>Edenborough,</hi> where he gives Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to all that would come in, and so all <hi>Scotland</hi> now becomes quiet. But in this March, and in the former part of his Life, there is omission of many and great Actions, which have not come to my knowledge, as having not received particular or exact Observations from any; many things worthy of memory must necessarily be forgotten in the crowd of so many Services and Merits: And the Relator not present, but in his last Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against the <hi>English</hi> Armies violent Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation in 1659. He that publisheth only that which is certain, needs not be ashamed of other Omissions.</p>
            <pb n="86" facs="tcp:55301:54"/>
            <p>Now all being Peace, and the Loyal <hi>Scots</hi> inforced to submit to the <hi>English</hi> Usurpation, they did not forget their Duty and Allegiance to their King, but being over-powered, they could no longer make Opposition, but (even those who had formerly but ill treated him, and unkindly, if not ungratefully used him,) seldome mentioned him without Tears; as this Author can witness, and hopes they were such as did testifie true Repentance; but finding neither present means nor hopes, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly betake themselves to their several Callings and Imployments. There is no small Courage in men, when they scorn to despair, but wait for a more propitious opportunity; to give up a good Cause, because it wants Success, is to turn Infidel and Apostate.</p>
            <p>The General that had taken Care for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Supplies out of <hi>England</hi> of Monies, for the due payment of his Souldiers, did so inrich the Country, that <hi>Scotland</hi> was never fuller of Treasure, and the Commodities there never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ended at a better price, that the Gentleman and Merchant never made better Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And the Souldiers were kept in such severity of Discipline, that Disorders were as rare as Prodigies; and 'tis almost incredible, with what Humili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y and Meeknesse the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours lived among the Conquered; that the <hi>Scots</hi> themselves began to fall in love with their Enemies, and wisht, that there were no
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:55301:54"/> other Contention between them, than who should be most loving one to the other. All their Priviledges were duly observed, and Articles given, were sacred; Trade and Traffick as it was encouraged, so it increased. And the General himself, who had alwayes an inclination to a Country-life, who much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in Planting and Husbandry, rented <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> a stately Palace belonging then to the Countesse of <hi>Backeleugh,</hi> and now to the most Noble Prince <hi>James Duke of Monmouth,</hi> about five miles from <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> where he had a very large stately Park walled about, and full of Trees, with two Rivers (as I remember) running through it, with a curious Garden and Orchard; where he lived in the midst of all the Blessings a Country retirement could afford. And took care that all others should enjoy the same Blessings, which he wanted not, relieving his poor Souldiers with good sums upon their Necessity, having also equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Charity for all <hi>Scottish</hi> men, that they should obtain Justice and Right, so that now no great man durst oppress his poor Neighbours. No Gentlemen or Noblemen, Heirs to the old Quarrels of their Ancestors (which are there called <hi>Feuds</hi>) durst exercise their usual Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Devastations, but were compelled to be quiet. Nay, some Church-men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, who had formerly been too busie and pragmatick in State-matters, now minded the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:55301:55"/> business of their Callings, Preaching, Faith and Repentance, and being contented with their Stipends; and in this good Condition Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Monck</hi> continued this Country, till he marched out of <hi>Scotland, January</hi> the first, 1659. Peace is a thriving-time, where all are getters, but those that live upon the Blood and Ruine of others: God preserve us in Peace in these Nations, for who ever begin new Troubles, will introduce their own Ruine.</p>
            <p>About the year 1655. <hi>Cromwel</hi> has a thirst for the West <hi>Indies,</hi> and for the Gold and Silver there, and to that purpose provides a great Army and Navy to send thither, which God justly disappointed, as a punishment of his Injustice and Avarice; being the first affront that ever went to his Heart, because his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of Success and Wealth was so high, there being nothing afflicts so much, as to fall from great hopes; but he had written to <hi>Monck</hi> about this Design, and glanced at an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he had, for to give him the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, which certainly had produced great Effects: For in all humane probability, as far as possibilities may be concluded of, the <hi>English</hi> had been in possession of the greatest part of the West <hi>Indies</hi> long before this time; which God prevented, that he might here be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of better good, both to King and People. This was a great Check to <hi>Cromwels</hi> Ambition, and, it is thought, broke his proud
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:55301:55"/> Heart; the Design failed, by the foolish Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of those Imployed, there being no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, but from themselves, Covetousnesse and Pride being the only Causes of their Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage.</p>
            <p>And now General <hi>Monck</hi> for some years lives very quietly, making no Noise, nor med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with <hi>Cromwels</hi> Businesse in <hi>England,</hi> which will afford us little memorable. At this time he fell into a particular Acquaintance with some of the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>Scotland:</hi> and what from his observation of their Worth and Loyalty, and theirs of his Justice and Moderation, there began to be a kind of hearty and mutual Love between them; and whatsoever prejudices he had too suddenly taken up before, he now praised and admired no sort of men more for their noble and generous wayes of Conversation, and with this Opinion he continued to the day of his Death.</p>
            <p>He was forced to be a little busie, by the Change of the <hi>English</hi> Regiments, which <hi>Oliver</hi> thought necessary (when he left the Commander in Chief so many years unchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.) There would in those new-Commers be such a number of <hi>Anabaptists</hi> and <hi>Quakers,</hi> (for all other Opinions at that time were not only tollerable, but social; for <hi>Presbytery</hi> was the Breach of the whole Country,) that the <hi>Scotch</hi> Ministers did take scandal, and sometimes
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55301:56"/> were disturbed in their publique Worship, which the General severely punished, (first asking <hi>Cromwel</hi> leave) he turned several out of the Army; and these were a sort of men that he had a great deal of Charity for, to pitty and pray for them, but never thought them fit for any Trust, being those that dispute all things commanded by the Church as well as their civil Superiors in the Government. These People are such that may safely experiment the mercy of Authority, but if ever they should get Power to their Will, they would introduce a miserable Ruine and Confusion, which God prevent.</p>
            <p>About this time Colonell <hi>Overton</hi> came down with <hi>Olivers</hi> Commission, to Command in the North as Major-General, being a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of a strong Ambition, and unquiet Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in Religion and Government, (though otherwise a Gentleman well born, and of competent estate, and not altogether unfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished of some other good parts); he highly stomached <hi>Olivers</hi> Protectorship, and thought such an Honour would better befit himself; He falls to practising with the discontented-party in the Army, and had several meetings at <hi>Aberdene,</hi> in order to Head the <hi>English</hi> Army in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and had drawn up a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, stuffed with many frivolous Pretences, and chosen Agitators to sollicit the several Regiments, who made their progresse about
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:55301:56"/> the Country: Thus far they proceeded, but not without the knowledge of General <hi>Monck,</hi> who had a suspicion of him, and kept good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence upon him; but at last their intended Design proving fit for execution, they fell into a Consultation how to assassinate the General, or secure him; but the first was protested against by some few, as not agreeable to the work of Righteousnesse, which they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to begin in B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ood: The General sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly changes and increases his Guards, seises upon the Confederates, and sends for <hi>Overton</hi> Prisoner, whom he sends to <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel;</hi> Tries several others, and displaces them from their Commands; so ended this great Plot, which was contrived in <hi>England,</hi> and was encouraged from thence, and from <hi>Ireland</hi> also. But God did miraculously preserve him, that he might be an Instrument to Chastise these men, who so earnestly sought his Ruine; And were not themselves a little instrumental to their own, by their madness and folly, who would let none live quietly, that were not as arrant Hypocrites as themselves.</p>
            <p>In the latter end of 1655. <hi>Oliver</hi> sent down a pretended Council for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which consisted of some no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Persons that have since given very good Testimony of their Loyalty in their Endeavors to Restore his Majesty, as the Earl of <hi>Orrery,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Carlisle;</hi> with these and some
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:55301:57"/> others the General was joyned, to whom I was appointed Preacher with another worthy Gentleman Mr. <hi>John Collins;</hi> though we will not boast of the Service, yet of our Masters we may, for four were great Restorers; and the poor man Colonell <hi>Whetham,</hi> who was an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument not only to deliver a City, but Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by declaring at <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> must not be forgotten. For where they do endeavour much the ease of the Country, and Relieves many distressed persons that had served and suffered for the King, from the great Grievances and Oppressions which they endured from their own Country-men; and in this Calm he close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hides himself, with reserves of further pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, when God should give him an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third of September,</hi> 1658. <hi>Oliver Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> departs this Life, and in his Bed at <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi> contrary to the expectation and wishes of most men, having been such a turbulent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine of War and Blood in these Nations; and a Blazing-Star that cast forth dreadful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of Blood and Mischief: He dyed as he lived, in a <hi>Storm;</hi> such an one as scarce was ever remembred, the Trees in St. <hi>James</hi>'s Park did bear witness to this Relation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides many other damages in publique Edifices and private Buildings. There was something generous in him, though too much poysoned with Dissimulation &amp; Ambition; &amp; the subtile
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:55301:57"/>
               <hi>Cardinal of France,</hi> who was his Confident and <hi>Privado,</hi> did give him too true a Character, that he was a Fortunate, though perjured Fool; which was a Panegirick after his death, not agreeable to that Correspondence which was held between these Two while they lived, who both agreed to give so much unquietness to these parts of the World. General <hi>Moncks</hi> Opinion of this <hi>Cromwel,</hi> after he was dead, was, That it was not possible for him to have held the Government much longer, if he had lived. All <hi>Europe</hi> hath reason to hate his Memory, as well as these Nations, for alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ballance thereof, and confederating with those that now indanger their Peace and Security; like an unfortunate Politician, he entails Troubles to after Ages, as if he had not done mischief enough living. <hi>Boccalin</hi> feigns in his <hi>Parnassus,</hi> that <hi>Aristotle</hi> did recant his old definition of Tyrants, and did Coin one newer, that Tyrants were a sort of men who lived in former days, but now the Species and kind were all lost; but certainly this <hi>Cromwel</hi> revived them, for he was a Tyrant, as Usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without Title, and Governing by Will and Pleasure, Absolutely and Cruelly; as the Author of <hi>Killing no Murther</hi> does wittily maintain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard</hi> being appointed his Successor in the Usurped Authority of the <hi>Protectorship,</hi> by his last Will, attested by Mr. <hi>Thurloe</hi> and Doctor
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:55301:58"/>
               <hi>Thomas Goodwin;</hi> the pretended Council sends Orders to <hi>Scotland,</hi> to have him there Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, as he had been in <hi>England,</hi> which (the Council being called, and General <hi>Monk</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, with the Magistrates of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and the Forces drawn up to the Crosse) was there Proclaimed. At the Council-Chamber, the Officers of State, and all others of any quality, convened to assist the Ceremony; where it was almost publique discourse among those called the Councellors, and other great Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, <hi>What should they Proclaim such a Person unknown to them;</hi> but they would with more chearfulnesse Proclaim General <hi>Monck:</hi> And when the Proclamation was read, the <hi>English</hi> Souldiers made no Acclamation, neither was any person therewith satisfied; and the usual discourse of the inferiour Officers was, <hi>Old</hi> George <hi>for my Money, he is fitter for a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector than Dick Cromwel:</hi> Though this was a matter but of common talk, yet it gave the Generals Friends and Servants a sure intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the popular affection, and general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to him, and was no small advantage to his future Designs. Popularity in a just and well setled Government, may endanger; but in changeable Times and Confusions, 'tis a great strength, and doth capacitate a man for great Designes; Whom the People Love, they will readily Follow, and as willingly Believe.</p>
            <pb n="95" facs="tcp:55301:58"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard Cromwel</hi> does now caresse the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral with frequent Letters, and dispatched some persons with great Protestations of Kindnesse, intreating also his Advice and Assistance, and letting him know, that his Father did recommend to him as an especial Command, to be chiefly ruled by his Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; The General Replyed, That he was very remote, and could not well tell what to write at that distance; and it might be judged not proper and expedient to those up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the place, willingly declining Matters of that Importance, but did advise him to call a Parliament, which was the Wisdom of the Nation, by whom he might be best instructed; and in persuance of this Councel, a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was called, which, after a little time, by the Violence and Sedition of the Army, abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and countenanced by his own Relations, <hi>Fleetwood</hi> and <hi>Disborough, Richard</hi> is forced to Dissolve it, and therein Unprotector himfelf. He might have taken for his device a Sword painted in a Wheel; what his Father got by Force or Injustice, he lost as foolishly. For though <hi>Fleetwood</hi> did not think to proceed so far, yet by the Artifice of <hi>Lambert</hi> and his Confederates, he was out-witted; and found that it was easier to draw the Army into Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Courses, than to moderate them; and that many men begin that (which proves a Rod to their own Backs) which they expect should
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:55301:59"/> be for their advancement: For he was (though a person of a pretended great Devotion) of a secret and violent Ambition; and because <hi>Oliver</hi> had once discoursed with him about his Succession, he had little quietnesse while his Brother was in the Throne; and perhaps he was better pleased with his Fall, seeing he himself could not enjoy it; And now the Officers of the Army being influenced by <hi>Lambert,</hi> who is restored to his Command, with many others, whom old <hi>Cromwels</hi> Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie had laid aside; they Resolve upon the Restoring of the Fag-end of the Long-Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which unconstant treachery (having not many weeks before, with all the assuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces imaginable, engaged themselves to <hi>Richard</hi> their new Protector, by their large Addresses) may stop their mouths, from charging any others with breach of Promise; and that pretended Parliament that they had so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently called a Pack of Knaves, and such as cousined the Nation, and were prodigal of its Blood and Treasure; now they fall down and worship them with the Titles of Eminent Assertors of the <hi>Good Old Cause,</hi> and such as had a special presence of God with them, and were signally blessed in that Work, as in thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:55301:59"/> yearly, but almost every moneth in those dayes in <hi>England;</hi> and none did more further the Kings Restoration, than his greatest Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>And this was an Artifice of <hi>Lambert,</hi> who did fully intend <hi>Cromwels</hi> Game, and to Ride the Rump for some time, till his Project was Ripe, and then to have slipt into the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But these subtile Heads were aware, and would not be twice deceived. A wise man may be deceived once, but he that is cheated twice with the same Gamster, or in the same manner, must be a very Fool; yet when God will leave the subtilest men to themselves, they shall be undone.</p>
            <p>In this <hi>Interregnum,</hi> if I may so call this Vacancy of the Usurpation, several persons came privately down with Letters to the General from some Officers of the Army, and <hi>Cromwels</hi> Relations, and others from <hi>Henry Cromwel</hi> out of <hi>Ireland;</hi> to invite him to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and give Check to the Sedition and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny of the <hi>English</hi> Army; Upon which, the General advising well, did make an absolute denial; but if <hi>Richard</hi> had not consented to the Dissolution of the Parliament, the General then had certainly marched, but not in pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his Quarrel, but with those Ends and Purposes which he afterwards did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish. 'Tis no small part of Wisdome to time business well; many Zealots that begin
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:55301:60"/> in a heat, repent at leisure for want of due deliberation; we must not make more hast than good speed.</p>
            <p>Upon Letters of advice from <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> that the Long-Parliament were returned to their Trust, all the <hi>Scotch</hi> Officers did comply with the <hi>English,</hi> in an Address to them, and so for the present all is quiet in <hi>Scotland.</hi> Now <hi>Fleetwood</hi> writes every Post to the General, and gives him an accompt of all Affairs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires that there might be an entire Friendship betwixt them, he avowing an old kindness in <hi>Cromwels</hi> time, and desiring him to intrust him in any Matters, and he should then find the reality of his Affection; now began <hi>Fleetwood</hi> to be jealous of <hi>Lambert,</hi> and that caused such expressions of love to General <hi>Monck,</hi> by whose Power he thought to ballance the others Ambition.</p>
            <p>The pretended Parliament having not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten how old <hi>Oliver</hi> had used them, grew apprehensive of the Armies former practices, and resolve to make their <hi>Speaker</hi> General, and all Commissions to be by him signed; and such Officers as were about the Town, were to receive them at the Hands of the Speaker in the House, while the Parliament was sitting. To learn men dependance, nothing conduces more than to let them know the Fountain of Favour, to whom they owe the Benefits they receive; the omission of this in great Princes,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:55301:60"/> renders their Ministers formidable to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, who ingross all the Thanks for that which is the free Bounty of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fleetwood</hi> and <hi>Lambert</hi> are much dissatisfied with this manner of proceeding, as contrary to those ends which they proposed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, of Rule and Dominion; but the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament were the more obstinate in their Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, because they saw it displeased the great Officers, whom they purposed to keep in such a condition, as they should not be able for the future to turn them out of Doors. Honest and good men are neither greedy to get, nor covetous to keep Power, unless it be in the way of Justice and Right; and the wisest that know the Cares and Duties at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, are more content to lay down, than to take up Places of Rule and Trust.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lambert</hi> and <hi>Fleetwood</hi> with five others, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Septemvirate</hi> by the proscribed <hi>Scotch</hi> Officers, get themselves appointed a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee for nomination of the Officers of the Army, for the new modelling it, here they think to answer their ends upon the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For all men of sober and quiet Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, they universally endeavour to turn out of their Commands; and all such as were turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and Anabaptistical, they place in their rooms, whom they hoped would follow them to give the Rump another lift; and there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55301:61"/> much jealousie between the principal Members of the House and the Army, so that now the Parliament began to expresse great kindnesse to General <hi>Monck,</hi> and looked upon him as a person that might become their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, if the <hi>English</hi> Army should grow disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to their new-made Masters: Thus Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Monck,</hi> whilst he lives quietly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly, is courted by several Interests, he engaging to none beyond civility, and appears as Umpire in all their Jealousies to ballance them; at last they feel his Umpirage, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining the Controversie against them all. Many that will not learn Peace and Quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but like mad-men disturb all the World, must be taught by Force and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and against their Wills to live peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lambert,</hi> after his return to his Command, writ several loving Letters to the General, but his love was very cold, being emulous of the Generals R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> General, they deal very severely with many of his Officers; and this Comittee for nomination had a great design to fill that Army especially with persons of Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Anabaptists, thereby either to weary him out of his Command, or else to tye his Hands, that they might be crossed by him in their Amibtions, when their time should serve; they did remove whom he most trusted, and put others (Creatures of their own) in their places; and they had done it, but that those that were new put in, did not hasten into <hi>Scotland,</hi> then they had prevented him in his Designe. This was so near a Concern, that he resents it to the Speaker, to be communicated to the House; in which he told them, He had heard of their intentions to displace many of his Officers, which he conceived they did not from any knowledge they had of their Persons or Qualifications, but the Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of others; and that he thought himself as fit to be credited as any, and did assure them they were all honest and stout men, and such, for whose fidelity and good behaviour, he would be ingaged: Perhaps, he was a little too earnest, and that made them the more sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious; yet the House had so great a regard to his Request, that they Ordered, That in his
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:55301:62"/> own Regiments of Horse and Foot, there should be no alteration, but with his consent, (his Regiment of Foot they could not have put in more violent persons hands than many of those were) and some others he preserved by the Vote of the Parliament, against the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of that <hi>Septemvirate,</hi> which was contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their own Orders; but though these Officers were voted out, yet he continued them by especial Orders, till the Commissions of the others came down, which never came; so that these Officers were they that, being turned out, afterwards turned out the Rump, and assisted his Majesties Restauration. They discerned in these Officers too much honesty and moderation, which was cause enough for suffering in those Times; and they shewed afterwards, that these Usurpers had reason to fear them.</p>
            <p>After the Dissolution of <hi>Richards</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (so I call it) wherein were many worthy Gentlemen, Patriots of their Country, and hearty Lovers of their Prince, whom then they hoped to serve, though they made a seeming compliance to the upstart Protector, (Dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation was almost necessary every where at that unhappy time in <hi>England,</hi> not only in Camps, but in Parliaments.) This did much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the sober Gentry of <hi>England,</hi> who are the great Interest of this Nation, and then the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the Rump, which had so long tyranized
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:55301:62"/> over these Nations, of whom they had been wearied many years before, by reason of their Oppression, and the renewed exclusion of the secluded Members, who attempted to return to the Discharge of their Duty, who were kept out by Force. This much provoked all honest men, and layd the Foundation of an Universal Designe through the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the Issue whereof is not my business to relate; yet I cannot but acknowledge that Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> did perform his Part, which, if all the Undertakers had done, they had not needed Assistance elsewhere; but they were all betrayed by such persons who now are not unknown, yea are well known for the ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest Monsters that ever Prince favoured; so that what miscarried was not want of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but by their Discovery they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, and seized. <hi>Decois</hi> and <hi>Trapanners</hi> are very Devils in that practice, first, to Seduce and Tempt, and then to Accuse and Destroy; we pray every day against such, while we put up that Petition, <hi>Lead us not into Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this time there was an universal Rumour in <hi>England,</hi> that General <hi>Monck</hi> was in that Designe, and all persons that came from <hi>England</hi> into <hi>Scotland</hi> did bring these Tydings; and he was engaged: For having received from Sir <hi>John Greenvill,</hi> now Earl of <hi>Bathe,</hi> his Majesties Letter, and other Letters
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:55301:63"/> from himself, with many other Messages by eminent Persons of his old Acquaintance to the same purpose; Sir <hi>John Greenvill,</hi> Cousin-German to the General, a most Loyal and Active Instrument in his Majesties Restoration, to whose Conduct and Prudence we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by justice to Attribute very much next the General, take all Occasions to secure an interest in him, and by all wayes and means endeared his Relations and Friends, most es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially his Brother Mr. <hi>Nicholas Monck,</hi> whom he presented to <hi>Kilkehampton,</hi> a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Parsonage as most in that County of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> where was his Mansion-house, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to keep a constant Correspondence with the General; and at this time intrusts his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Instructions with this Mr. <hi>Monck,</hi> to negotiate with the General about his Majesties Service; the General was wary and reserved, &amp; did not seem to listen over-much, but consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with those that were able and competent to serve him in that place. The General did summon one in whom he much trusted, and told him what Messages he had received, and asked him what he thought of this matter, which was so full of danger; to others, though never so near to him, he would not intrust his Opinion or Resolution, though often sollicited thereto. Many men may be zealous in busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that are not wary; Prudence is a vertue of value, but not thick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:55301:63"/> he that is not wise enough to choose fit Tools, will never have wisdom for the Wotk.</p>
            <p>This person was not ignorant of these Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses, but did wait when the General should begin the Discourse, and then in Reply told him, That it was expected from all honest and sober men, that he should in such a time as this appear for his Country, which, by the madness of the Fanaticks, was made the scorn of all other Nations, and did represent the danger that all men of Honour and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence were in by those frequent and ridiculous Changes; and that God had placed him in that Station for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t purpose; like <hi>Mordecai</hi> to <hi>Ester,</hi> to that end he came into that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, with many more Motives, which are not now necessary to be repeated; but they made a great Impression upon him; and then he began Discourse of his own inability, being at the Head of a froward and perverse Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Men, (so too many of them were at that time) that he could do little without their Assistance; yet he had such a Love for his Country, that he would chearfully perish for the Safety of it: and thus he agreed, that the person, whom he trusted, should break the business with some Officers, and himself would consult the publique Treasury, to see what stock there was to assist his Designe; For he knew of of old, that Moneys were the Sinews of War; yet he had to do with some such
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:55301:64"/> giddy-headed Fellows, that even Rewards would not engage them. When men are intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with wild &amp; false Principles in Religion, it doth strangely transform their Nature, and render them morose and opposite to all civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, hating and hateful to all the World. I am none of those that dare disgrace the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Profession, it is against my Obligations; yet I cannot but allow that Maxime, No Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine to the pretended Religious Vilaine, who scorns Heaven, and abuses all that fear God, by his Atheistical Hypocrisie.</p>
            <p>This person having received his Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by word of mouth from the General, was one of a popular and pleasant Conversation, and very acceptable to his Equals and Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, did deal very earnestly with some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Insolency of the <hi>English</hi> Officers at <hi>London,</hi> and wondred that they should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes receive Governments from them, who lived in the midst of the Pleasures of that City, while they endured the hardships of a cold and strange Country; to others who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to more Godliness, and remonstrated the Apostacy and Treachery of the <hi>English</hi> Army, who sent down their Addresses to them, to joyn in their Subscriptions, calling <hi>Oliver, The Chariots of</hi> Israel, <hi>and Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men thereof,</hi> with much other profaneness; yet within a week perfidiously broke all their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Religious Engagements, with such
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:55301:64"/> other matters as was occasioned by their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes; but all unanimously answered, (though dealt with all severally) <hi>That why will not old</hi> George <hi>do something,</hi> (so they familiarly called him) <hi>It is not in our Power;</hi> but being all asked, Whether they would stand to him, and what Interest they could make in their several Commands; all that were moved in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, chearfully resolved to follow him, and gave good assurance of those under their Command, which were the principal Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in that Country, and the Forts that were near the Head-Quarters; and for the rest, there were wayes enough to deal with them. The Head-Quarters of an Army are like the Court, all others follow their Fashion; and Military dependance is so strict, that he must have little Courage or Conduct that is deserted by an Army, except after ill Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.</p>
            <p>The General calling for an accompt of what Monies were in Bank in the Hands of the Treasurers at War, and in the Receiver-General's for the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> found things not amiss there, and he presently Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves to fall upon the purposed Design. But some <hi>Remora</hi> there was, that upon the Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of an Universal Plot in <hi>England,</hi> the pretended Parliament intreated him to send two Regiments of Horse and two of Foot, which did much weaken him; and whether
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:55301:65"/> they did this out of Fear and Necessity, or Jealousie, I cannot affirm, as not being of their Council; but the first I am apt to believe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they also called Forces out of <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Flanders:</hi> And he was so observant to their Commands hitherto, that he gave no ground of suspicion to them; All his Actions being for Peace, all his Advices for Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unless his Love and Zeal for his Officers might render them afraid. It was necessary in those Times for the General to be very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle busie in Publick Matters, and he found it so also in these; after he had done the great Service; some therefore think he was not so able, because not willing to burn his own Fingers.</p>
            <p>And yet in spight of all Discouragements, he prepares his Declaration, and some other Papers ready to be Published, which was on a <hi>Saturday</hi>-night, and so no further Proceeding therein could be made till the week after; but all was well agreed by about four others; whom he trusted; but the next day being <hi>Sunday,</hi> express came of the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>feat of Sir <hi>George Booth;</hi> upon which accompt, the General did Resolve to suspend his Design till a fitter op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, though then he did not build much upon the Designs in <hi>England,</hi> and those kind of Plots; for he hoped to have stood upon his own Legs, and not to have leaned upon such
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:55301:65"/> imaginary Supports: For he knew how use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less new-raised Men are, let their number be what it will against old experienced Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, it was a very preserving Providence. While we admire the Policies of Men, we forget to adore the Wisdome of God, which was manifoldly seen in this great Change, and if God had not secretly prevented, it had often miscarried, as I could instance in many particulars.</p>
            <p>Had he then declared, the <hi>English</hi> Army would certainly have concluded him in the Plot, and then their Forces would have been encouraged against him, and his own (I doubt) would some of them have deserted him. This was his own motion, which I took to be by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inspiration; for he burnt the Papers, and gave an especial charge of Secresie, but I have reason to believe he was betrayed in this affair; and at the same time had a secret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of the great Difference between <hi>Lambert</hi> and <hi>Hazelrig,</hi> which was then as much as to say, between the Parliament and Army, and he only waited for that better opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but this did very much dispose and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare him for the following Engagement, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving then setled a Correspondence with his Forces, and learnt whom to put the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in. To know men, there is required
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:55301:66"/> some study, that is, Experience and Trial; many prefer this knowledge above the pedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of Books; but the more we know men in this Age, the less we shall like them. They are Books that are gilded, and well bound without, with Complements and specious Promises; within nothing written nor intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but like Paper-Books, that are never to be used.</p>
            <p>Some time after this, the General (whether to sound the Intentions of the Parliament, or try whether they had got any discovery of his purposed Design, or for discontent, because of their removing of his best Officers, in whom he most confided,) sent up a Letter to the <hi>Speaker,</hi> earnestly desiring dismission from that Command, and the Reasons alledged were, that he was aged and infirm, and his great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to retire, to live upon his own Inheritance, which he had scarce time to see since he was a Child; and no disswasions, nor earnest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, could hinder him from this purpose, though it was urged, how impossible it was, in such a private Condition, for him ever to do any thing considerable for his King or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; but he had wiser ends, and thereby did remove both their Jealousie, and make them Court him to his continuance in <hi>Scotland.</hi> This was a dangerous adventure, and might have made him ever uncapable of great Attempts; but when God hath chosen an Instrument to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:55301:66"/> do his Work, none can pluck it out of his Hands.</p>
            <p>This was by the Artifice of some about him, who were privy to the Contents of the Letter, and advertised the Speaker; before his Letter was delivered, who privately called many Members, who were his Friends, and all agreed together, that it must be suppressed; for if it were read in the House, then they could not but take him at his word; thus these Persons that had not so much Honour as was necessary to render them in the Opinions of the World honest, yet stood much upon their Reputation. All this proceeded from their Apprehensions and Fears they had of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Officers of the Army, who threatened their removal; and so they did seek to shelter themselves under the Name and Fame of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Monck,</hi> whom they vogued their assured Patron; who afterwards shewed, that the great Boundaries of his Service were Loyalty and Religion, which were no Tools fitted for the Work they had to do. He did seem to Trespass against these Boundaries for some time, but it was with <hi>Hushai,</hi> to get into a Station, where he might have the best oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to serve his Soveraign.</p>
            <p>The Officers of <hi>Lamberts</hi> Army, by the Ambition of their Chiefs, who were restless till they had restored themselves to that Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Power which was formerly in such
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:55301:67"/> Grandeur, as to give Laws to all others, and receive none themselves (after the Defeat of Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> and his Party) as Triumphant they would regular the House; and as if by cattering a few new-raised men, they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced many Provinces to their Obedience. Pride and Insolence ushers in Destruction; seldom they miscarry, that fear their own fall.</p>
            <p>They take upon them at <hi>Derby</hi> the 16<seg rend="sup">th</seg>. of <hi>September,</hi> 1659. to debate the Actions of their new-made Masters, and to condemn them of Ingratitude, and neglecting the Affairs that were most for Peace, and a lasting Settlement, especially not effectually, pursuing their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals; but at last they agreed to draw up their Desires and Complaints in a kind of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, which the House got notice of, and expressed their detestation of such Factious Councels: The Petition did contain many Instructions to the House, but especially that <hi>Fleetwood</hi> and <hi>Lambert</hi> might be great Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, with ample Authority to put them down, &amp; in their own time to set themselvs up, or put it to the hazard, who should win the Prize of a new Protectorship, with some other frivolous matters, which was a Bind to these desires: But this would not pass the House, It was vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Needless, Chargeable, and Dangerous to have any more General-Officers, and had it under Consideration to commit the Persons that brought the Petition; but this latter
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:55301:67"/> was omitted; the Officers of the Army did justifie themselves in a long Apology, and did make many more insolent Demands in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation, which was not at all acceptable to the House; but they for the strengthening themselves, and to get more Subscriptions, do dispatch Copies unto all the Forces in <hi>England,</hi> and into <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> The Army (as all standing Forces will soon grow putrid and corrupt, without great Care, especially if their number be great,) became a distinct Body from the interest of the Nation, and, like the <hi>Mamalucks,</hi> did Resolve to Govern for ever.</p>
            <p>General <hi>Monck</hi> who Resolved not to joyn with the Army in these their Ambitious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, though they were willing he should share with them, it being one part of their Petition, That he might be General of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry; He prohibits all Officers under his Command from Meeting or Subscribing, and returns Answer to the chief Officers, that he could not impose that upon others, which he would not do himself, and that many of his Officers were not well satisfied with such manner of Proceedings; and he writes to the Speaker, to whom he gives an accompt of these matters, and declares his Resolution, Not to engage in such violent Councels, but keep his Officers in Modesty and Obedience; but these Letters arrived not, till after the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:55301:68"/> House was again raised by the Army, where we must take occasion to speak of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, as being the good opportunity that General <hi>Monck</hi> chose to render his Purposes the more concealed, and by an honest tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing with one Party a little while, to enable himself to supplant both; For making this Answer, he communicated and advised with one Friend, who told him, That the refusal of that Subscription would cause him to fall under Jealousies, and that he must sharpen his Sword, and prepare himself against the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Army, for that refusal was <hi>Rubicon,</hi> and there was no going back; To which he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, That by the Grace of God, he was resolved, and ready. This was the best occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that could be taken to divide the Army, for in <hi>England</hi> many Officers were weary of that madness, that was daily exercised by the Forces there, and were ashamed to be made Stales and Slaves any longer, as they used of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to discourse.</p>
            <p>Two Acts of the pretended Parliament did much forward the General in his Designe, the one discharging all Levies of Mony by Taxes, Customs or Excise, or any other way, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the consent of the People first had in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and the Actors to the contrary, to be guilty of High Treason, which he caused to be Proclaimed in <hi>Scotland</hi> and the North of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>These Acts were Printed and Published, and came down in the Common Pamphlets or News, that same Post that brought the Tyde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Armies Force upon the House; which was much wondred at; for had the Packet been stopped a week, and the <hi>English</hi> Armies sent down some ill-affected persons, they might very easily have disordered all his Purposes; so that still we must confess a great work of Providence, and though many contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and cross Actions, yet all tended to the furtherance of this Work. General <hi>Monck</hi> now declares, and stands upon his own Legs, we shall see what he will do, now he sets up for himself; he will be a Journey-man no longer for Usurpers and Traytors, but serve his old and right Master.</p>
            <p>Thus far we have shewn you our General a valiant and great Captain, that did such won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Valour and Conduct, that he is a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:55301:69"/> might well imploy all the Wits of Poets; and whose Actions so prodigious, will make Posterity question all for Romances, in respect of the Restoration; But now we shall shew you him in this Negotiation of his Majesties Happy Restauration, as wise as couragious, whose prudent Counsels, wary Reserves, and politick Addresses ripened a business, that perhaps no other man else could have done; it would almost make a man despise the Pedantry of Books, and the Discipline of Schools, to see a Gentleman bred in the midst of Drums and Trumpets from the Sixteenth year of his Age, to out-wit Politicians, and such as have been versed in the Arts and cunning of civil business all their Lives: The Politician doth well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that Success is tyed to persons whose temper doth suite with the Times they live in, and to prove this, he instanceth in <hi>Fabius Maximus,</hi> a very fearful old man, yet this was the Buckler of the <hi>Roman</hi> State, because after such loss of vital Blood by <hi>Hannibal</hi> and his <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> it was necessary to gather new strength and spirits before they hazarded any more; but hot-headed <hi>Terentius Varro</hi> (whom the Politick State of <hi>Rome</hi> courted for his cowardly running away at the Battel of <hi>Cannae,</hi> and called it not despairing,) did by his rashness very near bleed that Common-wealth to death. General <hi>Moncks</hi> temper did well suit with his business; he was of a silent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:55301:69"/> nature, one that thought much, but spoke little, unless to those that he trusted much, and knew well; he had no spirit of Contradiction, to answer the Discourses of any, but to listen with great patience, and much observation, and make no cross Replies, which caused all persons to go away well sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and indeed perswaded that he assented to their Proposals; he usually did so, before he discoursed what he would do: All that I can say, is, that God did peculiarly fit him for the Work that was to be done; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I enter into this Negotiation, I think it necessary to wipe away an Aspersion or two, that some that envy his Glory, and reproach his Memory, charge him withall; and these are many of them that never could do the King other Service than drink Healths; and pour out Oaths; a kind of Hectors that are the Kings worst Enemies, and such as by their sins and debauchery did contribute to his Exclusion, and retard his Restauration, with some others, that perhaps enjoy great Places and Favours, with the qualification of no Deserts, who would render all of as little worth as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; These both confidently affirm, That he did not intend to bring the King in, that it was fortuitous, and the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Right Reverend Father in God <hi>Mathew,</hi> late <hi>Lord Bishop of Ely,</hi> who was his
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:55301:70"/> Fellow-Prisoner many years; who, when Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Monck</hi> took his leave of him, being freed from his Imprisonment, and requiring his Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Benediction; he told him, That now he was going into <hi>Ireland</hi> against those bloody Rebels, but hoped he should one day do his Majesty Service against the Rebels here, and so was dismissed with his Blessing; and this the Reverend Prelate hath often testified with great joy and content before many Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and Right Reverend Lords of this Land; and he was known to be a person both of ancient Piety, and such severity of Life, that no man will dare to question the Integrity of this Testimony; we could bring many other eminent and honourable Witnesses to Vouch, but our Christian <hi>Plato</hi> shall be instead of all.</p>
            <p>I confess, having heard this often by several others, it would make a man wonder whence so great a confidence should proceed; For he was now to be but a puny-Colonel, &amp; that in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and how could he ever expect to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster those vast numbers in the Three Nations, and answer the performance of such a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise: I must here crave leave to tell you a story, and because none may believe it forged, for this Relator hath heard it above fifteen years ago, and is able to bring good Testimony thereof; While General <hi>Monck</hi> was in the Tower, one Doctor <hi>Laybourne,</hi> a Professor in
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:55301:70"/> Divinity, and a <hi>Romish</hi> Priest, came often to see the General in the Tower, and it was upon some little acquaintance which he had with him in the Company of Sir <hi>Thomas Cademan,</hi> the late Queens Physi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ian; some Friends of his asked this <hi>Laybourne</hi> (if I do not mistake his Name) <hi>Why he gave himself the trouble to visit this</hi> Monck <hi>so often;</hi> He Replies, <hi>That within some years that person should be the greatest Person of the Three Nations,</hi> (and so he was for some time, before the Kings Return); and long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the same person being at Supper with the General and other Friends a little before his Expedition into <hi>Scotland</hi> with <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel;</hi> he publickly asserted at the Table, <hi>That he should within Six Moneths, or thereabouts, be a General in the North, and within some years should Command the Three Nations:</hi> This indeed proved truth, but by what means this <hi>Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourne</hi> pretended this fore-knowledg, I cannot imagine; I do not remember that he ever cast his Nativity, but some think, that he took this up from secret lines and marks in his Face; which would render the story very incredible, though the General had a Souldier-like and Majestique Countenance; but this is certain, that <hi>Laybourne</hi> came out of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands after his Majesties Restauration, and visited the General, and also that he did Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of this long before: Now that such a vain Prediction should have any influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:55301:71"/> the Generals Faith, is to me very doubtful; I know he never listened to such vain Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks; he told me this story himself in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> But to leave this idle diversion, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue the Answer of the Objection. They think that he intended it not, because he did not publiquely declare it; These are wise Statists fit to Govern; Is every one bound to publish what they intend to do?</p>
            <p>This is Tavern-reasoning, and certainly these are Enemies to the Kings Restauration, for as surely as the King is restored, he would never have been by the General, had he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared for him in <hi>Scotland;</hi> For what powers of men in the Three Nations would have as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociated against him, of all the new Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasors, and other Novelists in Religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the dissipation of his own Forces, and the strengthening all the Armies of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland:</hi> For in those dayes our good King, and best Friend, was called <hi>The Common Enemy;</hi> and many men of great Estates, whose fears would have united them against the Kings Interest; so that whosoever doth make this Objection, doth tacitly wish the King and General had miscarried; For as many Loyal Persons came to presse this upon the General, his Officers and confidents at that time, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were suborned by the Phanaticks to sound him, and if he would but have promised that the secluded Members should sit again, great
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:55301:71"/> offers were made of Assistance; but this was an Artifice: For if that had been but grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they had concluded the King had been the consequence; so that the greatest care he had, was not to break upon this Rock: For in truth many persons whom he knew to be Loyal, yet did not think their discretion suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to bind up his Life and Fortunes in it; so that he would not declare till he was at <hi>London,</hi> when, with the assistance of the Kings Party, he could do what he declared.</p>
            <p>Now if any shall o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ject why he did make Addresses to the King no sooner, he was too wise to trust his Life and Fortunes in the Hands of many indigent Courtiers, and knew too well how many there were secret Pensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners to the Usurped Powers, who dipt their hand in the Dish with the King, and kissed him with an <hi>Hail Master,</hi> yet betrayed him; and he was not ignorant that an Address from him to the King, of that nature, to promise his Endeavour of his Restitution, would not long have been kept within the Cabinet, but crept abroad among the little Spies and Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencers, and flew over into <hi>England</hi> to bring his Ruine along with it, and a disappointment of his intended Service; but if any sober man doth need any further answer, let me demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate his intention as far as the nature of the thing will bear, that is, he did it when he could; and when he did it, he could have
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:55301:72"/> hindered it: Nay, he was much importuned by all <hi>Olivers,</hi> and the Common-wealth party, to accept the Government with what Name and Power he pleased, and those of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentest Opposers of <hi>Olivers</hi> Government; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they then pretended to see, there was no other Basis of Settlement than a single Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: Can any man say, he did not intend it, because he did not declare for the King when he was in the Tower Prisoner; why, truly in such a Condition he was till his arrival at <hi>London,</hi> till he h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d separated those Forces which were here together quartered, a far greater number than his marching Army, yet for all that he could not be sure; and they which knew the difficulty of dividing those old confederated Regiments, who had so long and so successfully Fought together, would not make this Objection; and without divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Army, it was impossible for him to have done any good; and had certainly mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried, if he had not concealed himself, and given great charge to all his Confidents and Servants to be also careful in that matter, lest any suspicions might arise, of which he was very jealous; and the bitterest Enemies he had, did nor could otherwayes give him any trouble, but upon this pretence; and their on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desire was, that he would have followed these Objectors Policies. Those about him knew that he never had any reason nor cause
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:55301:72"/> to be disaffected to the Kings Family or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. In the year 1657. he told a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Friend at <hi>Dalkeith, That the King would be Restored before the Thirtieth year of his Age;</hi> Being asked, <hi>By what means he came to that Knowledge,</hi> He Replied, <hi>By one that had cast his Nativity;</hi> The person answered, <hi>That he had heard something of that nature;</hi> and further, <hi>That He should be Restored by a Monk,</hi> which Discourse was interrupted by others entring the Room.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>George Booths</hi> Declaration does not name the King in it, yet all men know it was his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; the Addresses from the City, and all the Countries in <hi>England,</hi> are only for a free and full Parliament, yet none will question, but they required this, but as a means for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Restoration; and when the General did divide the Army, he did couragiously Resolve upon this Design, and as soon as he was in <hi>London,</hi> he did declare and do what he always intended to do, but was so wise, to stay till he was able.</p>
            <p>Those, that would seem to contradict this undeniable conclusion of the Generals full and constant purpose to Restore his Majesty, affirm, that the Rumps voting from him his Commission, was the first occasion. But these <hi>Vertuosi,</hi> for all their great Depths and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, must be contented to be instructed in the passages of those Times; the General never
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:55301:73"/> had any Commission, but acted, as it was sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, as one of their Commissioners, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of Seven; in the time of the Interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there was sent him from nine or ten of the Council, a kind of Paper-Commission, without full Authority and Power to give any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to constitute Officers, and this was void upon the new Election of another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of State, which was long before the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral arrived at <hi>London,</hi> and never was renewed after his Retreat into the City, and requiring a full and free Parliament; they reduced by Act (as they called it) the Seven Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to Five, wherein he was still one, and the first of the number; therefore we may judge some men very erring, wherein the World is not well skilled, when they dare avow such grosse Untruths in things that have flown about in the Diurnals; so that there was no loss of Commission in the case, but just and resolved purposes of Loyalty.</p>
            <p>Some suppose there was an Oath in <hi>Scotland</hi> taken against his Majesties Restoration, which is a Falsehood so boldly affirmed, that I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the confidence of the Reporters. For there never was any Oath imposed in the four years that I was there, before the Generals declaring, and I was alwayes residing at <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> where I never heard of any such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and can assure to the contrary for that time; and when he treated with the <hi>Scots</hi> for
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:55301:73"/> help, such an Oath would have rendred them his resolved Enemies; and it would have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased all his Friends in <hi>England,</hi> who did Correspond, and promise Assi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tance; Farther, though he concealed himself, yet he began up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the motion of Sir <hi>John Greenvill,</hi> as several can testifie, and other Engagements of Loyal Assistance. I would not assert a Lye, for as I remember the Engagement was taken once by some persons upon the Rumps return to Power, but many Officers left at liberty, who were thought to be engaged enough by their Commissions. For the Oath of Abjuration, which was only imposed upon the Council of State, whereof the General was one; he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways abhorred it, and disswaded all his Friends from it. Their Charity may be spared, who would put the General and his Officers upon this <hi>Dilemma,</hi> that either they are perjured, or else never intended the Restoration; so that they think it kindness to believe them guilty of the least evil. But that supposed Oath was never heard of in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but an invention of some mens Brains, for to reproach those who have well deserved. I commend the wisdom of these men, to whisper these things in the dark, for otherwise there are disbanded <hi>Cold Streamers</hi> that would teach them more truth, and to abstain from such Scandals, that reflect upon the Conscience and Honour of so many generous Persons. To call in the testimony of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:55301:74"/> some Drunkards, who never were worthy of trust in the least business of concern, as Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictors to the Generals Service and Intentions, is to declare whence all this frothy Discourse proceeds, that it is but the vapour and foam of Wine; For undoubtedly, men in their Cups will arrogate that to themselves which never came to their knowledge, till it was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished. The conversion of many, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a few great, some suppose without Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, was the happy Revolution of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties affairs, too many following Success, rather than the good principles of Conscience and Justice; but that the General, who began and concluded this great Affair, surely he could not owe his Loyalty to his own Actions, for they flow from Principles, and this was a necessity of his own making: Had he other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise purposed, like <hi>Pompey,</hi> with a stamp of his Foot, he might have raised violent Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows sufficient for any Opposition.</p>
            <p>To attribute Matters that were preparing and debating for some Years, and many Moneths in executing, to blind Chance, is to destroy the Divinity, and a subversion of the liberty of humane nature; for Chance then will be as obliging as the Fate of the Stoicks, that is, all the World is ever at a Peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. He that Acts by the most deliberate Reasons, his Actions must be Fortuitous. To charge Actions upon Persons that were 300
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:55301:74"/> miles distance removed, and not consulted at all, is not very generous nor agreeable to great Pretenders to Vertue.</p>
            <p>He must be a great stranger to those two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to assert that the General did take any Suggestions, but rather give to him, contrary to some mens supposition. 'Tis an easie matter to collect <hi>Rhapsidies,</hi> and jumble them together, to the defaming the reservedst of men, much more the General, who was exposed by his various Imployments to much censure, and by serving his Majesty in that eminent Occasion, and thereby disobliging all the several Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and pretended Purchasors; and by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding the Army, angring a multitude of Officers, and not endeavouring to reward the imaginary Services of some Dependents, who revenge with their Tongues the loss of their Hopes. And his great Favour and Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities was not over-pleasing to the poor Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alists: From all these, a Volume might be easily picked up by his envious Enemies, and matter to drown the Reputation of the best Man; but it will be found, that Malice will never be able to blur his Memory, nor plunder him, though dead, of the Glory of his brave Services for his King and Country. But ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Age shall admire what this despiseth, and this Age shall be despised for not admiring what was Praise-worthy. Many Truths are not fit for all Times, but they will ripen, and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:55301:75"/> become easie of Digestion, without the abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive reflection of Sauce, and Sippets; Cloudie and affected Notions, will vanish before the light of the truth of an Impartial Relation, which is the product neither of Passion nor Interest.</p>
            <p>The next Objection is not worth the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering, because it is made by those that are Enemies to the Kings Safety and Government, and would expel him again; For their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is, the Kings Restauration, and with Him all that is precious to us, that is, that the General did betray his Trust, break his Word, declared for a Common-wealth and the Rump, and engaged for Liberty of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, afterwards acted contrary to all these publique Assurances; these are all grievous Accusations. But we shall find, that they are but vain Suggestions; for he betrayed no Trust, for he had none; he had formerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a Commission from <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> he died, his Son fooled himself out of the Saddle; the Rump truly sent a Commission signed in some blind Ale-house in <hi>London,</hi> when they durst not shew their Heads in the Streets; and he received it as one would do a Letter, and did not take it as any Authority to him to Act, who had done his business three Moneths be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. He acted by the election and consent of the general Council of his Officers, by whose Vote all business was agreed upon;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:55301:75"/> yet he re-established them, gave them no Controul, they had time enough without his Disturbance; nay, but that they thought to sit ever within those Walls, and tyranize over the Free-born People of <hi>England,</hi> they might have set up their Common-wealth, which was by equal and frequent Representatives, but this was, said they, <hi>To bring in the King,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the People of <hi>England</hi> were universally so inclined, so that you may see what they mean, that the Rump should Govern for ever; but the General declared for Liberty, but this was the worst of Slavery. Now I would ask such persons, when all the City of <hi>London,</hi> and all the Counties of <hi>England,</hi> and even their own Friends made their continual suite to have a free and full Parliament, else they would neither pay Taxes, nor give any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission; should the General knock most of the People of <hi>England</hi> in the head, to keep some twenty Regicides in Power and Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; for all other men joyned with the rest of the People in their Desires, and even the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of their Council of State would not sit nor take the Oath of Abjuration, so that they themselves did divide and destroy themselves; for using all means of tenderness, and all ways to satisfie them, but nothing would do, unless they might Rule for ever, which was so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the Constitution of a Common-wealth, as there cannot be a greater Tyranny.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:55301:76"/>
            <p>There were many of their principal Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers met with the other that had been seclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and expressed their consent to receive them; and how had they forfeited their right of Membership, but by being too honest for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly for such Company; and they were kept out by the force of the Army, which had but too justly thrust them out of Doors also; and now all force was removed, why should they return without their Brethren; and if the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral did declare for the Parliament, it was as it ought to sit by due Right and Law, which was as justly theirs as the Rumpers; but this they forget to take notice, that he declared, that the end of his appearing was for to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Military Power to the Civil, and then certainly the secluded Members returned to their just Right.</p>
            <p>The General alwayes thought he had made good all his Promises for a Common-wealth, in restoring the People to the Election of a full and free Parliament, who might have esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished what they pleased, without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul or interruption; And thanks be to God, the <hi>English</hi> Nation are a free People, who do enjoy the liberty of their Persons, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of their Estates more than any Nation in <hi>Europe,</hi> and no new Laws or Taxes can be imposed, without their consent in Parliament; and what can be for Commonwealth more, but for these Priviledges. We are bound to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:55301:76"/> remember our Kings with Love and Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness who indulged them. Liberty is a Name and Shadow, none so real as under a good Prince; nay, one Tyrant is more tolerable than 400.</p>
            <p>Now to that of his Declaration to the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered Churches concerning Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, 'tis too well known what his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours were before the Laws were established, he waded so far in that business, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was in danger and necessitated to r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>treat; yet what Liberty would these men have, they may serve God in their Families, nay, they may have several Friends joyn with them; so that I have often heard him say, <hi>If they meant well, this was enough;</hi> and how would the poor Christians in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> value such a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, and be thankful to God for it. No wise man is angry with another for his diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in judgment, but such as are busie and practising for a change, are to be prevented and suppressed. For these men think they have no Liberty, unless they can raise Tumults, and gather great numbers of People, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch them out of their Loyalty and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and what hath been the issue of the late Indulgence, but an intollerable insolence of the vulgar People against the Magistrates, in preparation of a new Rebellion, which was his own sense in this matter. But why these discontented Persons should bear so much an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb facs="tcp:55301:77"/> to the General, I can see no reason, but their own passion and prejudice. For he contrived not those penal Laws against them; his Duty, as a principal Minister of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, was to see all Laws put in Execution, yet he did it with that tenderness, that they much injure themselves, by reproaching him: For he could do no otherwise, unless they would desire he should turn Rebel against King and Parliament, and renounce all his declared Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses.</p>
            <p>But for a fuller Answer, the General in all Papers, and publique Declarations, did prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally declare to defend Magistracy and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery; now for what could these be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood but a <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Bishops,</hi> the two Sources of all Civil and Ecclesiastical Power; besides, that he would adhere to the Laws and Rights that were purchased by the Blood of our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors (which was the very expression that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> to joyn with him:) now by this what could be meant (and who could expound it otherwise) but the <hi>Great Charte<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>But if it should be yielded, that the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral did pretend ill, and with purpose to do the greatest good, what could be deduced hence so Criminal; did not <hi>Hushai</hi> deal wisely with <hi>Absalon,</hi> with the direction of <hi>David,</hi> a man after Gods own Heart, and without any

            <p>I have been the longer upon this matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I have known men of very good nature and parts that have been deceived; and though some of them that are Deceivers, who take up these Professions for to delude others, and make Religion wait upon their Ambitions
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:55301:78"/> and Lusts (which are the worst of Atheists); yet there are others like some of <hi>Absalons</hi> Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, <hi>That went in the simplicity of their Hearts.</hi> Many of these men convinced in the justness of the Generals Cause and Quarrels, did heartily joyn with him, and did persevere to the last, and were well satisfied with all proceedings for these Reasons. I have been the larger to satisfie these Persons, that they may have wherewithall to stop the Mouths of Gainsayers. I would have none so understand me in this Discourse, as if I would justifie all his actions; For we have learned from God himself, <hi>That every man is Vanity, and a great man is a lye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The General, before his Declaration, had made a great preparation for this Work, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in <hi>London</hi> setled many persons who were interested, by their Imployments, in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all matters then on Foot, and by some secret wayes had very good Intelligence upon all the Actions of the pretended Powers then in being; and because many persons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known one to the other could not conspire to deceive him, therefore he encouraged the Correspondence of all, and thereby was the more secure when their Informations agreed. Secure persons, like those that are desperately wicked, despise publick Censure, and mind not the Reports of the World; but the wise and wary do attend to Fame, and would
<pb facs="tcp:55301:79"/> know the sense of all Mankind, especially when ingaged in publick Business.</p>
            <p>His second Care was well to understand the affections and inclinations of the Officers of the Army, for they were the Weapons of his Warfare, and without such good Tools, the best Artificer can do but little. After he had sounded such by his Instruments, who were known to be remote from the Hypocrisie and violent Principles of the Time, (for in that Army there were many that had never been concerned in the <hi>English</hi> Wars, and perhaps were as Loyal as some that did eat his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Bread abroad,) and found many of them of such a sincere and generous Spirit, who protested as much Zeal for such a Work as could be desired; and many others, who were displaced, (seldom men of parts use to mistake their Interest) these for to continue their Commands, which was their best livelihood he was most sure of. Poverty sometimes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses us to Vertue, but that is a small degree thereof, which is grounded upon necessity, if any; he that follows Vertue for Interest, and not for its own native Charms, is untruly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Vertuous.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding, for three or four Moneths before he did publiquely declare, he did take care himself to examine the Packet, with one other whom he did trust, which was a business of no small trouble, the Post going and coming
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:55301:79"/> between <hi>Edenburgh</hi> and <hi>London</hi> six times in seven days; and to do this more privately, he spent many whole Nights, when all others were in Bed, and all this, that he might well understand whom he should most trust: For no Undertaking can prosper, while those that are imployed in it betray it; but he was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful not only that they should not be Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, but that they should be Zealous in the pursuance of those Ends he declared for; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving satisfied himself, and well deliberated with a few, who were men of greater Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments than Titles, and such as followed Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty more than Profit, who thought it the greatest Glory to do for their Country at such a time, and willingly consented to any Oblivion of all their Service.</p>
            <p>On the Seventeenth of <hi>October,</hi> 1659. the very day that he had the Advertisement, that the Parliament was forced by <hi>Lambert</hi> and <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> he laid the project of his intended design, and that day and the most part of the night in advising and preparing Orders for the managery of the whole Affair; and gave spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Order, that no Packet should move to <hi>England,</hi> that thereby they might have no jealousie of his Preparations. He sent for some Troops of Horse to meet him at <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> and appointed Major <hi>Hubblethorn</hi> to have the Regiment commanded by him at their Arms, (this Regiment of the Black Colours he had much confidence in).</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:55301:80"/>
            <p>On the Eigthteenth of <hi>October,</hi> 1659. (St. <hi>Lukes</hi>-day) he took his own Guards with him from <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> and marched to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> (there his own Regiment of Foot quartered, which was not drawn forth) he seized all such Officers as he knew were not well satisfied with such an undertaking, and secured them afterwards; He drew the Forces into the Field, and gave them an accompt of his Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, to adhere to a civil Authority, and not follow the <hi>English</hi> Army in their mad Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, and Fanatick Courses, which was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with great joy by the Souldiers, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so by the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nation, who were hopeful this might be a means to break their Yoke, and leave them at Liberty. No Nation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Slavery can be at Ease, and who will blame them for endeavouring to break the Chain; Liberty with Power is better than rich Servitude; and to be a man for ones self, is to be prized above great Service.</p>
            <p>After his return out of the Field, the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor</hi> of <hi>Berwick</hi> sent an Express, That he feared that he should not be able to secure that Town for him, almost all his Officers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Anabaptists; so that presently he gave Order for a Troop of Horse to fetch away all those ill-affected Officers into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and delivered Blank Commissions for the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to put in whom he pleased, but it was hard to get a Troop to march that could be
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:55301:80"/> trusted; For the Captains alledged, that that very day they had marched twenty miles, and that the wayes were deep, (being the latter end of <hi>October</hi>) so that they were not able to perform it, without some time of rest for their Horses; but Captain <hi>Johnson,</hi> afterwards the Generals Major of his own Regiment of Horse, being perswaded, by setting before him what danger we should be in, if that Town was lost, which was so considerable, and within forty miles of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took it, and arrived there the night before Colonell <hi>Cobbet</hi> entred the Town, who had seised it for the <hi>English</hi> Army. All the dissent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Officers were surprized, and sent into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the next day he secured Colonell <hi>Cobbet,</hi> and conducted him with some others to <hi>Edenburgh</hi> Castle. This was an especial Providence, for had this Garrison been secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Generals Enemies, he had been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much streightned, and possibly his design whol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y frustrated. Upon all occasions we did find it was God, not Man, to whom we owe our Deliverance.</p>
            <p>The same day the General dispatched away Expr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sses to invite several of the Officers, who were in strong Citadels, or at the head of their Regiments to meet him at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> to Consult with them about matters of Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; but by the way, by some persons they were secured, and brought into Custody to
<pb facs="tcp:55301:81"/>
               <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> where they were admitted to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with the General; but finding those persons (according as they were Characteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed) to be seditious and averse to his Designe, he continued them under Custody, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed their Commands. Better restrain a few for a time, than leave all in Slavery; and our nearest Friends must forgive us, if we value our Safety above theirs.</p>
            <p>On the 20<seg rend="sup">th.</seg> of <hi>October</hi> he goes to the Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of <hi>Leith,</hi> there takes possession of that Garrison, where was the most considerable store of Arms, Ammunition, and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions, and was received with great joy, and a very great entertainment for himself and the Officers that attended him, with the discharge of all the great Guns in the Citadel. Having secured the Head-Quarters, and those Officers that were discharged, others of more courage and honesty put in their places: There was a general Council of Officers called, and there the justness of the undertaking against the inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the <hi>English</hi> Army was approved; all protested faithfully to adhere to this Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but there were some that desired some admonition should be given to the chief Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in <hi>England,</hi> before they entred into Blood with their old Friends; and it was not safe to oppose such a motion at that time, yet it was secretly condemned by the wiser and honester part, as that which would give them an Alarm
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:55301:81"/> too soon, and considering that many of the Generals Forces were above two hundred miles distant, that were not only to be Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desvouzed, but new-Officered and confirmed; yet that all tenderness might be used, three Letters were presently dispatched by a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger of their own, who was not so honest as to keep to his Instructions; one to the Speaker, to know whether the House was forced, the two other to <hi>Fleetwood</hi> and <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> to inform them what Intelligence was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that they had violated all civil Authority, that they would hazard their Lives for the defence of the Laws and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which had been acquired by the Blood and Lives of their Ancestors, with many other resolute expressions. In popular Assemblies, they which will have Authority, must appear with Reasons for the good of all, and nothing is so taking as Laws and good Government in a lawless time.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the General was not idle, knowing what an Imployment he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken; and that is no time to trifle, when Life and Fortune is at stake. He therefore speeds to <hi>Linlithgoe,</hi> to settle the Forces in the west, where he had appointed a Rendesvouze, for the Regiments quartered thereabouts; and after having declared to them the Grounds and Reasons of that Enagagement, he required them to march Southward, after he had advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb facs="tcp:55301:82"/> some of the Officers to higher Commands, such as were active and faithful to this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement. If a Souldier had not hopes of Preferment in his Eye, he could never look upon Danger so steadily.</p>
            <p>He returns to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> where he and those about him did not neglect any opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to improve their Interest; and thereupon dispatched Letters of Addresse to the Army in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to many particular Persons and Garrisons in <hi>England,</hi> who all returned by Messengers of their own a negative Answer, That they could not see the end of his Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and did not think that the Offence of their Brethren in <hi>England</hi> did need so sharp a Remedy as to run into Blood, and therefore craved leave to dissent from his Methods, and did modestly offer at some wayes of Treaty, for mutual satisfaction. To hear the Reasons of Oppressors, is not to yield up the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, sometimes they strengthen rather than weaken our Judgments.</p>
            <p>Thus he was left alone, but his great Mind did not at all despond, nor any of his principal Officers (Opposition being to them Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement); He published several Papers and Discourses concerning the Nature and Ends of the Controversie, which gave no little satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to his own Forces, and put his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries to many Evasions, to make any kind of Answer. With their expostulatory Letters
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:55301:82"/> which they returned, they commonly chose persons that were very cunning and popular to be Messengers, that should secretly debauch his Officers from their Duty; and of this sort of Vermine came many both from <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> These men did not a little mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and without all Controversie, it was negligence to admit them into the Quarters, and omission not to punish them for their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery and falsehood.</p>
            <p>There being then a considerable Fleet riding in the <hi>Downes,</hi> he thought fit not to neglect them, but give an accompt of his Proceedings to them, knowing that his Name was not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten amongst those brave Souls, with whom he had so successfully engaged against the <hi>Dutch;</hi> but at this time he had a very cold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, they being over-awed by some Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders ill-affected to this Design of Foot; but when the weather changed, and it began to clear up in the North, and the North-Star shone bright, then they knew how to sail ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Compass, and tack to their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. While Hope and Fear are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable Properties and Affections of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, they will decline Danger, and endeavour Safety and Profit.</p>
            <p>All Parts returning denials of Assistance, the Officers he displaced, having liberty to attend their business in clearing the Accompts of their Companies, grew very insolent in the
<pb facs="tcp:55301:83"/> Streets of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and drew many into dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content to joyn with them; and this proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the great advantage of the General. For many fearful and cowardly Fellows that did fore-see evident Dangers from all Enemies abroad, and present security with their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears upon giving up their Commissions, began very fast to decline the Service, which intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced sure and faithful men into their rooms; but the General was forced to distinguish with them, that he could not furnish them with the publique Moneys to go to fight against him, and leave himself unfurnished of Pay for his own Souldiers; those he displaced, he would satisfie, but others who might have continued their Commands, he bid them seek their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears of them to whom they were going; and thus he freed himself of above one hundred and forty Officers, who were either men of no Courage, or corrupt and dangerous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; a good riddance. For in a civil War, Neuters and indifferent Persons in an Army are more dangerous then the Enemy; as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining in a Siege is worse than a Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>The General had a great Care to keep two Doors open in <hi>England,</hi> and therefore he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched Captain <hi>Deane</hi> with his Troop of Horse to summon and secure <hi>Carlisle,</hi> with Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the Governour; but this honest Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain was (instead of getting that Garrison)
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:55301:83"/> like to have been lost himself, for the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour held him in treaty till his whole Troop forsook him, and entred the Town. Honesty alone, though necessary, yet there is something more requisite to an Officer, to make him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat &amp; qualified for a Command over others.</p>
            <p>How inconstant are the Judgments of vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar men, especially when they are under the temptation of Gain or Fear: For no Troop was esteemed more confiding, yet proved thus basely treacherous; there were three Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Horse then in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and four Troops of Dragoons under Major-General <hi>Morgan,</hi> which were (upon the Generals de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring) made a Regiment of Horse, and two Troops more added to compleat them; but too many of these were too obstinate against the Engagement, being corrupted with Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and by Messengers from <hi>England,</hi> but of this more anon.</p>
            <p>There were ten Regiments of Foot in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but very remote, of which he resolved to use but six in his marching Army; and though he looked very stedfastly forward into the <hi>English</hi> Affairs, yet he was resolved not to forget to take a little Care of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to have an Eye behind him, that they might have no cause in the <hi>English</hi> Army to complain, that he had given up a Country, which he was entrusted to secure. There had been in those usurped Times four Citadels built, at the
<pb facs="tcp:55301:84"/> charge of above Three hundred thousand pounds, as so many Chains to keep the Loyal <hi>Scots</hi> in Slavery; which being victualled and gunned, with the Armes and Ammunition there in store, did amount to a further value, which were at <hi>Leith, Aire,</hi> St. <hi>Johnstons</hi> and at <hi>Inneress;</hi> There were upon the North-Sea three, and one upon the West, such regular modern Fortifications, as perhaps all <hi>Europe</hi> could not shew better, and to be relieved by Sea in case of Land-Sieges: In these, and in <hi>Sterling, Dunbarton, Edenburgh,</hi> and some other Castles, he resolved to leave the four other Regiments with some loose Companies, with good Instructions, and did not doubt to secure all behind him, which was not only a retreat in case of necessity, but an argument of his faithfulness to his own Country, that such an Affair of deserting <hi>Scotland</hi> should be from the Command of a lawful Authority. 'Tis easier to yield up a Country, than to gain one; yet there may be more Honour to Resign, than to retain with injustice and Oppression.</p>
            <p>About the Four and Twentieth day of <hi>October,</hi> the Messenger from the general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of Officers arrives at <hi>London</hi> with the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the General to the <hi>Speaker, Fleetwood</hi> and <hi>Lambert,</hi> which had been printed at <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> and with a Declaration to the gathered Churches, which he was directed to print at <hi>London,</hi> because it would have offended the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:55301:84"/> violent Presbyters in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and the sum of it was, <hi>That they should be assured of their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties both Civil and Spiritual;</hi> many Officers both of the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scottish</hi> Army being Members of those Churches, (for good honest men of Parishes were scarcely capable of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in that Army); this was thought necessary to abate the heat of their Zeal, and render them quieted as to the free enjoyment of their Principles, which did not a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the whole Affair; that it was not a War intended against any Profession, but against the particular ambition of the chief Officers of the <hi>English</hi> Army; so that many of these did very inconcernedly behold the issue of this Controversie, and others of them not a little concerned for the Generals Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, being convinced of the Equity of the Cause which he declared for.</p>
            <p>These Letters &amp; Papers did strangely amaze the pretended Authority, then constituted by the Name and Title of a <hi>Committee of Safety</hi> and they could not dream of such a Danger from the North (but most times our worst Dangers come from whence we fear least). And when they considered the manner of his proceeding, and the quality of the Person that had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, they speedily apply themselves to all wayes of remedy. They remembred the Opinion that <hi>Oliver</hi> had of his Martial Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and <hi>Lambert</hi> himself did rather envy than
<pb facs="tcp:55301:85"/> despise him; but they wondred much more whence such Designs should come into his head, and to take them at such a time of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, when their Armies were divided, and to deal so wisely with their own Proselites (the Church-Members) as to take their Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from them. But these preaching and professing Saints were mistaken in the man, and had not the gift of discerning. For like <hi>Junius Brutus,</hi> he did conceal himself, and took the best of Times to redeem his Country; they thought him an ignorant and meer Souldier, but they were forced to come to School to him to learn Policy, (and, but that they were unteach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in that point) honesty too. This Lesson is not easily learned by old Sinners, and such as have thriven by Deceit.</p>
            <p>This Alarm breaks their Rests, and keeps them in Consultation all night, (Fears and Crimes do keep waking). They alwayes doubted that this Cloud that had hovered so long on the Hills of <hi>Scotland,</hi> would in the end pour down a sad Showre: They first fall upon fair means; they were afraid to provoke this rouzed Lyon. On the Second of <hi>November,</hi> two Persons of some Eminency arrived at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> to use their Interest to perswade an Agreement, but this was to add Oyl to the Flame; For those Perswasions were but the effects of their Fear, and so interpreted; but in a civil War, 'tis not safe to refuse
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:55301:85"/> Treaties for Peace, lest by such obstinacy you lose ground with your own side, which is no small advantage to the Enemy. They made but an ill choise of their Agents, for these em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, were very hearty for the Generals Engagement, and did good Service afterwards at <hi>London,</hi> one of them more especially. So great a Work required great Assistance, and many have deserved a Remembrance for their Diligence and Service.</p>
            <p>The General made what hast he could to get his Forces together, but the Season was very cold, and Wayes bad, and they were in remote Quarters, so that he was forced to have patience; but yet to make shew that he was in readiness, and to amuse the Enemy, he sent Major <hi>Knight</hi> with four Troops of Horse, and Major <hi>Miller</hi> with six Companies of Foot, to secure <hi>Newcastle,</hi> by which means he would have been able to receive Assistance from <hi>York-shire,</hi> and other places; but when these For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces arrived at <hi>Morpeth,</hi> they had Intelligence that <hi>Lilburn</hi> with a considerable Force was entred <hi>Newcastle,</hi> upon which, by Order from the General, they were commanded to take up their Quarters at <hi>Anwick,</hi> and there to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue until further Order: The missing of this Town of <hi>Newcastle</hi> turned to a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, (as all things do when God blesseth a Design.) For <hi>Lambert</hi> was ready before the General, by reason of the Forces that were
<pb facs="tcp:55301:86"/> quartered Northwards after Sir <hi>George Booths</hi> Defeat, who were ready for a March, and not very remote, and would have besieged it, and thereby obliged the General for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief thereof, to have put the Controversie to the hazard of a Battel before he was well provided, which would have disordered all his Affairs, if not ruined them: For time, though but a circumstance, yet tends much to the Honour and Quality of Actions. Victory without Blood is most pleasing to a wise Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; Sword and Fire are severe Remedies not to be applied, but in the greatest extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>Business multiplied upon the Generals hands, and though before he made use of the good advice and pains of his Friends, yet he now resolves to Constitute a <hi>Committee;</hi> some of the eminentest Colonels of his Army, who had been from the beginning in the Service, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> one or two other, who were well versed in all Affairs (all Councils are framed some for shew, and some for business.) To this Committee he gave Order to prepare An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to all Letters from the general Council of Officers in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> which were so numerous, (as one Council of Officers at <hi>London,</hi> another at <hi>Newcastle,</hi> with another at <hi>Dublin,</hi>) that it was no small business to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age this Imployment; but the <hi>English</hi> Army in <hi>Scotland</hi> well understood that their Enemies
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:55301:86"/> were gifted-Brethren, and that the Skirmishes would be with Pen and Tongue, wherein they in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> were better skilled than with their Hands; However it had chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced formerly that they should be such great Conquerors, it would not be unpleasant Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery to print the Papers that were exchanged. They did like two Women, that (scolding) call one another Whore, and perhaps both are not mistaken: They did accuse one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Breach of Truth, when too many of them had been guilty of Treason both against God and the best of Kings. Men naturally censure the Crimes and Guilt of others, and hide their own.</p>
            <p>He authorized this <hi>Committee</hi> to hold Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and to appoint such as they could trust to examine the Packets, and stop Letters, to remonstrate all such matters as they thought convenient, and fit for his knowledge, and to that purpose, used, upon notice given, to retire to the place where they usually conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And in truth these persons did their parts, and dealt in all things generously and faithfully; so that we had little need of Arms abroad, when we had so good Counsel at home. The Sword, if it be not in the hand of Prudence, makes but mad work in the World.</p>
            <p>Now we were facing about, and to move as we were, and we must needs begin in the
<pb facs="tcp:55301:87"/> old Methods of Government, for the General had his <hi>Privy Council,</hi> which was this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, and his <hi>great Council</hi> of all Commission-Officers in the Army. It was a pleasant sight to see the General at the end of a Table, in a Room full of Officers, putting the question, (as many as consent to this Proposition, <hi>Hold up your hands,</hi> which was their Ceremony of assent,) and then an <hi>Ensigne</hi> to make a long Speech to the contrary (who was but started from a Corporal the other day) but all this he did suffer for the good of all, and love to his Country. Let those that think he was not early enough in his declaring, but mark this Memoire; For Admiral <hi>Colignie</hi> used to say, <hi>It was an horrible thing to Command an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Volunteers,</hi> but it must needs be dreadful to be as it were commanded by them; but though he submitted to these Forms, yet he kept an absolute Authority by the Prudence and Artifice of those he trusted, but did it by the way of Councel and Perswasion; and though he was good at Driving, yet he was now forced to lead gently. He that cannot suite himself to the time, will seldom acquire or retain greatness.</p>
            <p>The great care that was taken, was to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techise the Soldiers well, into the Principles and <hi>first Rudiments</hi> of their duty and obedience, and to spirit them into an understanding and sense of the Quarrell; For upon the meeting
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:55301:87"/> of the <hi>Scottish</hi> and <hi>English</hi> Forces in the Field, it was supposed (with good probability) that they would with difficulty enough be brought to fight one against the other, and much feared they might one part runn over to the other; therefore to fix the Souldiery, all endeavour was used that there should be appointed good Sergeants and Corporalls, who are the Eyes and Hands of every particular Company; and such as have more opportunity to observe the discourse and inclinations of the Soldiery, and authority to make good impressions upon them: these were particularly charged to do their duties, with promises of preferment, (which is a motive that never fails) and private directions given them to discourse upon their Guards upon the justness and necessity of the Engagement, and because these might not be able Orators, (though in truth many were; for prudence and fitness for business doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lodge with poverty in a cottage, as well as among men of greater dignity) there were several <hi>printed papers,</hi> setting forth the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every <hi>Englishman</hi> to oppose the Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Army under <hi>Lambert;</hi> and a <hi>Dialogue</hi> between a souldier of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Army and the <hi>English,</hi> where the whole Quarrel was stated; and every week there was an Officer of the Army (who was guilty of a little wit) appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to write a <hi>Gazette,</hi> and these were to be dispersed among the souldiers, and read upon
<pb facs="tcp:55301:88"/> the Guard. These are small things in accompt among some men, that think all men must bow before them, and hazard their lives upon their beck; but there was nothing that did more as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure the Army, and render them more forward for the service, than these plain and honest arts; and though their number was not great, yet their Chearfulness was so manifest, that it was hard to determine whether Officers or souldiers were most willing to the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Reasonable Creatures are best guided and influenced by Justice and Reason, not by Force and Power.</p>
            <p>Still continued the Batteries of the <hi>English</hi> Army by continual Messengers with Letters and expostulations, which might please the Printer to repeat, but would nauseate and weary the Reader; being a Fardle of such pretended Godliness and Righteousness, that it would make a man tremble to read the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisies of these men, who had too much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded the World, that they had no other Religion but what their own power and profit dictated to them; but those that had the care of these matters among the Officers, though they smiled at these fair pretences (yet when their safety was concerned, this was no small means) thought fit to pay them in their own coine, and <hi>with the Cretians to play the Cretians:</hi> as many serious persons when they come into vain Company are forced to discourse vanity;
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:55301:88"/> Sometimes we must answer a Fool in his folly, lest he prove wise in his own conceit.</p>
            <p>Among those that came from <hi>England</hi> some were so villanous that the Gallows had been but their due, who so tampered with the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that they poysoned a great part of the Horse, (of which we had but few to spare) Four Regiments were all, and those very wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in their full numbers; And now they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to run away in whole Troops; <hi>Robinson</hi> (a Captain of Dragoones lately preferred to the pay of Horse, he and his Troop for that reason thought fit to be trusted upon the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to watch others) ran away with his whole Troop to <hi>Newcastle,</hi> and after he had received Back, Breast, and Pot for them as markes of their new Dignity, in being promoted from Dragoons to be Troopers; and they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with great Triumph. Most of <hi>Twisle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> Regiment refused the service, but being quartered in such convenient places they were dismounted, and Red coats put upon their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. This did not a little terrifie some great pretenders to Courage that were with us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they feared that we should not be able to bring it to an ingagement, and that others might follow the example of those Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants.</p>
            <p>These were hard shifts, and yet among the Foot no mans heart failed him, and they
<pb facs="tcp:55301:89"/> would say, We will fight without Horse. I believe there are many that blame the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals proceedings, but at this time would have thougt it wisdome to have dissembled a little: For the great Objection that these sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fellows made, was, That the KING was in his Belly; but I am sure they were near the matter, for he was in his heart, which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes Loyal, and this appeared as soon as ever he was capable to serve him.</p>
            <p>After all these messages the <hi>Independant</hi> Churches, who were so thankful for the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies declaring for their liberty and securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they took upon them to be Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors for peace and Agreement, and to that end they sent down Mr. <hi>Caryll,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Barker,</hi> with this Character, that they were the <hi>Ministers of Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Messengers of the Churches,</hi> and they did not disgrace their Character, deporting themselves with all manner of prudence and justice, not intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with matters either in private or publick. For the General desired them to preach in the <hi>Trone-Kirk</hi> at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> which the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> lately impropriated to themselves: All their negotiation was to prevent Blood-shed, and to endeavour Unity among all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; a very good and suitable work for a Minister, and I wish at all times, all others had gone upon the same errand; but with
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:55301:89"/> them (as Intruders) came down Commissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry General <hi>Whaley</hi> and Collonel <hi>Goffe,</hi> with Mr. <hi>Hammond</hi> of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> who did not so well follow the example of the others, but se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly sought to alienate the Officers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to paroll, for otherwise the Generall would not have admitted them into the Head Quarters. 'Tis safest to treat an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my at some distance, for while they seem to negotiate one businesse, they do another.</p>
            <p>The General, who had alwayes a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for such as were, or were called Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of Jesus Christ, had frequent and private Conferences with them, and to give them all the satisfaction they could desire, admitted a Conference more publique, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he called some of the most Intelligent Officers of the Army, and some others that understood the Arts and Subtilties of these kinde of people, (for then it was usual to mix Policies with Religion, I wish it be not now too much in fashion) For tis usual with men to pretend Gods service, when they do their own business.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Caryll</hi> spoke long and well, with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments Christian enough, but if I should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat any particulars, I must invent them, which though it be after the example of ancient and modern Writers, who have taken too much liberty of this kind, to shew their own wits rather then the truth of story (in which I shall
<pb facs="tcp:55301:90"/> crave liberty to be excused); but at last he came to charge that all the Blood that would be shed, would lie upon the General; upon which, he could not stay without interrupting him, and that with so much reason and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, that, I believe, all the Auditors were well satisfied; if I should repeat his words, you would think I did make use of Invention (which I have just now reproved.) But I assure you, that he did so far answer, that the Objector himself acknowledged himself satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; and after many other Discourses, which were managed with much Calmness, all part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Love and Peace, and with hopes of both between the two Armies.</p>
            <p>About this time came down Major General <hi>Morgan</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> upon the desire of <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> to disswade the General from his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, whose heart aked at a War with the General, whom he alwayes feared, and never loved. This Gentleman is one that had given such good proof of his Skill and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct abroad, both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> that, I believe, I may make him General <hi>Moncks</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and at this juncture of time he came down to second him, and told him what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions he had to disswade him; but he did take the Message more willingly, because he was resolved to joyn with him in all Hazards, in pursuance of what he had declared; but he would do like a Souldier, and a man of Honor,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:55301:90"/> he would deliver his Message, and then if he would not consent to it, there should be no difference. For he would not leave him, but keep at his Command, which was in <hi>Scotland.</hi> This little-man was of more worth at that time to us, than the seventeenscorce Officers that had deserted the Service, and was no small Instrument to settle and manage the Horse, (who (as I told you before) were very Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and unwilling to the Service,) with <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> came also <hi>John Troutbeck</hi> Doctor in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, and an excellent Chirurgion, whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the General alwaies loved, and was very pleasing to all the Officers of the Army, and brought an assurance from the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> that he would not fail to be Assistant to him; which was kept very private, lest it might be published to his prevention. Sir <hi>Jeremiah Smith</hi> was a person in whom the General re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Confidence, and was Assistant to Sir <hi>Thomas Morgan</hi> in the modelling of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Horse. Such a difficult Service re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired stout Hearts, and active Hands; and many others ought in justice to be mentioned with Honour.</p>
            <p>After so many Letters and Messages, the general Council of Officers did agree to a Treaty, and that to be at <hi>London,</hi> and appointed three persons for the Imployment; one other was named, but he could not be spared: They had publique Instructions from the general
<pb facs="tcp:55301:91"/> Council, but private from the General, to sound the state of matters, and to use judgment and discretion upon the place. But they were made almost Prisoners, and watched day and night, till they gave their consent, being surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by a kind of violence and importunity. And such rumors boldly asserted, that all the Generals Army had forsaken him, and that his Regiments of Horse had revolted to <hi>Lambert,</hi> which was the reason the <hi>Scottish</hi> Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners hastned to an Agreement.</p>
            <p>Among other Messengers that were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed into <hi>Scotland,</hi> there was one, a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man well bred, and of good parts, who came as a Mediator, and after many Discourses, (he being lodged in the same Quarters with one of the Generals Servants) it was represented to him that <hi>Lambert</hi> was a person of Valour and some Honour, and why should he engage with others, who had neither wit nor honesty, but if he would relinquish, the Lieutenancy of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> might be easily obtained. This Gentleman desired that the same might be assured out of the Generals own mouth, which was done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; but upon informing of this to <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> this Gentleman reported that his Answer was, <hi>That he was not able to govern that unruly Army to which he was Head.</hi> Great Promises, with honest Purposes to perform them, is good Policy; Had this Gentleman joyned for the Kings Service, he might have deserved well.</p>
            <pb n="145" facs="tcp:55301:91"/>
            <p>At this time all diligence possible was used to rendezvouz and model the Army; and though there was a Treaty set on foot, yet none of the wiser sort expected any good by it; and they that had any influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence there, were resolved not to trust to it. But while several Regiments were commanded up towards <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> there were several loose Companies that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered nearer, that were drawn forth to compleat them, because those Companies that properly belonged, could not arrive; and among those, one was quartered at <hi>Musselborough,</hi> that were all willing for the service: but their Officers deserted them; and they would not engage, unless they might have a new Election, and chuse them themselves: This was very pleasant, but must be born withall at such a time; for a Civil-Warr will not endure severe Discipline. Colonel <hi>Charles Fairfax</hi> was ordered by the General (an honest and gallant Gentleman, to whose Reputation and Faithfulness we may justly ascribe very much; for he was one of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourablest Instruments that the General used) to present the Commission-Officers to them, and to employ his discretion to quiet them: The Name of <hi>Fairfax</hi> was enough to reduce them; but yet they
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:55301:92"/> would chuse their own Serjeants and Corporals; which the honest old Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman gave leave to: but, like the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Capua</hi> in <hi>Pacuvius</hi> his time, they could not agree, but all would govern, and none be governed; which did render them at last willing to take such as their Superiors did appoint: We did then see a Comedy that had been acted at <hi>London,</hi> represented at <hi>Musselborough.</hi> Man's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity is God's Opportunity; and the greatest Anarchy and Confusion, is the ready means to a just Settlement.</p>
            <p>About the beginning of <hi>November,</hi> the General calls a Convention (I can give no other name to it) in <hi>Scotland</hi> by his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to every Shire to send two Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners, and every Burrough one, to <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> there to confer with him about Matters that concerned the Peace and Safety of the Countrey.</p>
            <p>They all understood his meaning; for his Declaration was spread all over <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> and they made a brave appearance of the Nobility and chief Burgers. The Proposals were made to them in writing, to prevent the Jealousie of the <hi>English.</hi> After the General had given them thanks for their Kindness and Condescention, that Persons of so great Honour would
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:55301:92"/> undertake at his request such an office of Kindness; and told them, That to avoid all distrust, he had some Proposals, which he tendred to them; or, as I remember, they were read to them by his Secretary in the presence of the <hi>English</hi> Officers, lest they should be unsatisfied with his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses to the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nation. 'Tis not safe to lose old Friends, to acquire new Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintants.</p>
            <p>They took time to deliberate, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised a speedy Answer. The chief Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals were, To advance the Assessments that were in arrear, because of his present necessity to march into <hi>England</hi> for the Liberty and Honour of his Countrey, to free it from the Tyranny and Usurpation of the Army; with desires of advice, how the Countrey of <hi>Scotland</hi> might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in peace, and what order should be kept in the High-lands and Borders, to prevent Misdemeanors and Plunderings in his absence; with many assurances of thankfulness, and that he would undertake the business himself: That a kindness of this nature to <hi>England</hi> at such a time as that was, should never be forgotten; and that he would be an humble Suiter for all that they could desire. Which language was very pleasing to the <hi>Scots,</hi> who did
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:55301:93"/> well understand the General's Designs. What men desire, they quickly understand, and as easily believe.</p>
            <p>After deliberating for some time, they answer by the Earl of <hi>Glencarn,</hi> That they humbly thank the General that he would give them so much honour as to consult them in his great Affairs; and for his desires, that the Assessments that were due, should be paid; they would (upon their return into their several Shires) take effectual care to advance them timely enough before his March: Which they faithfully and cheerfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. Now some do think <hi>Scotland</hi> did raise money upon their own account; but that is a mistake: For <hi>Scotland</hi> was at that time with many Subjects in it (may none be now there, or here) very poor, but loyal: they offered bravely, To raise Twenty thousand men, Officer'd with the best Nobility of the Countrey, and march with him; though they did not then well know the business, yet having had so much experience of his Justice among them, they did believe that it was Noble and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous: Which was a gallant Proffer, and would have been as truly performed; for they assured, it was for their love to the English Nation, whose Honour and Safety
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:55301:93"/> they professed to venture for, as for their own; and they doubted not but they should share in Liberty and Freedom with them. The <hi>Scots</hi> Fingers did itch to be handling Arms; and as it is the nature of Mankind, to desire that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited; or, like Children, to cry for a Knife, though formerly it hath cut their fingers. The General was very sensible of this great Obligation; and did resolve, if his Forces had not stood firm, or that he had received any great affront from <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> to have engaged with them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely have espoused the King's Quarrel: but he did fore-see this would be a bloody and tedious way to serve his Majesty, and had it in reserve against last extremities. A good Physician never useth violent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, when gentle will perfect the Cure.</p>
            <p>They parted with a great deal of satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and kindness; and because he knew not how soon he might march, he appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the 13th of <hi>December,</hi> that he would treat further with such Commissioners as the Convention should appoint at <hi>Berwick;</hi> where they afterwards did convene accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly: at which Convention some very just and reasonable Propositions were made by several principal persons of the <hi>Scotch</hi>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:55301:94"/> Nation, and had very civil acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and such directions as agreed with the preservation of their peace and safety; and though they urged for more power to arm themselves, that they might not be exposed to the fury of <hi>Lambert</hi>'s Army, if the General should miscarry, and what they proposed was equitable and fit to be allowed: but they were entreated to rest satisfied with what was already granted; and to assure them, that within a little time they would not be denied; but for the present he could do no more, for fear of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to his own Officers, and enraging <hi>Lambert</hi>'s Army, wherein he had many Friends, and such as had given him good assurance of their diligence and care in time to serve him; ana at his request they were satisfied. And thus ended this Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, wherein the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nation were unanimous to assist the General, and great furtherers of the King's Restauration; and thereby did witness to all the World, the sincerity of their Loyalty, in that, though they were deluded, yet not obstinate sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to Majesty; the Name of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth being odious to them, and the worst of Tyrannies. Among the Nobility then were most active, and well deserve our remembrance, the Earls of <hi>Rothes, Roxbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:55301:94"/> Athol, Glencarn,</hi> and <hi>Weems,</hi> and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others, who used their Interest to make all <hi>Scotland</hi> to comply with the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral's desires.</p>
            <p>The General, about the eighteenth of <hi>November,</hi> hasted all he could to draw to the Borders, having most of his Forces now in the South, and all modelled and officer'd, very brisk and couragious; so that he goes before, and leaves many Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers behind to dispose their Families, and take order in their Affairs for some few days. The General being at Supper at <hi>Haddington,</hi> in order to a journey to <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> was by some English Officers sent by <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> saluted with the Agreemenr made by the Commissioners of the General Council of Officers in <hi>Scotland,</hi> with them at <hi>London:</hi> He gives it to his Officers (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had read it) and retires to his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and gives not his Opinion thereof: but the Officers raged at it, as destructive not only to theirs, but the three Nation's safety: Truly there was many, if not most of them, Men of Honour and Justice that were then employed, that had not their own concerns in consideration, though poor enough, but such as were publike, and for the good of all. That Night the news of the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment comes from <hi>Haddington</hi> to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:55301:95"/> where was yet several Regiments, and many Officers of other Regiments, who convened together, and fell into a rage, and the thing was worse represented then it was, but yet not safe at the best; for the English Forces would have continued their Tyranny, which was not to be endured, but by those who could not contribute to a Remedy, as the old Loyal Party at that time. But these <hi>Cold-Streamers</hi> (like Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists) could finish a Cure with the first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</p>
            <p>The next day the General returns to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh,</hi> for his business was done at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:</hi> after a little refreshment in private, he comes into his publick Room, where he walks very melancholy and dark, and says not a word a great while: this was a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment, and did lye very heavy upon him. One with whom he always used to be free and pleasant, in what Humour soever he was; and this person taking care of his little Concerns at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> for to dispose them to safety, and was immediately to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and not at <hi>Haddington</hi> the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; he comes into the Room, and as yet the General had not spoken to any Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, though many Colonels and others were about him: seeing that Gentleman, How now, says he, What say you to this Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:55301:95"/> Truly, Sir, says he, I have not seen it; but I hear so well of it, that I am come to make a little request to you this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (for it was before dinner; the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral was stirring early, his Mind being stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before)? What is that I wonder, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies? Even that you would sign me a Pass to go into <hi>Holland;</hi> yonder is a ship at <hi>Leith</hi> that is ready to set sail. What, cryes the General, will you now leave me? This person replies, I know not how you may shift for your self by your Greatness, but be confident, they will never be at rest till they have torn you from your Command; and what they will do with you then, it concerns you to consider: but for my part, though I am a poor man, I will never put my self into their power, for I know it will not be for my safety. The General replies hastily, Will you lay the blame up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me? If the Army will stick to me, I will stick to them. Upon which all present gave assurance, That they would live and dye with him; and there was such joy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Officers, that some expressed it almost with tears in their eyes; and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, That all their Officers were ready to mutiny because of that Agreement; and that there was no man but what was out of love with it so perfectly, that they would with joy receive the tidings of its rejection,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:55301:96"/> and with shouts, and the loudest acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. These honest men, for such a service deserve (wheresoever they are) to have the favour and Protection of His Majesty for their Honesty as well as Gallantry. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing tended more to the King's Service, than this Brave Resolution; for had these poor Officers tamely entertained this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, those that boasted they did the Service without them, would not have been able to have born an Head upon their Shoulders.</p>
            <p>And now there was another face of things, the General very serene and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and the Officers full of mirth and jollity; and a general Council of Officers called in the Afternoon, and they were all men of good understanding and reach in business, and knew the passion and wrath of the Sectaries in the English Army against them, and they were resolved not to lose themselves basely, and without discretion; upon prepared suggestions to the pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test of them, Not to refuse the Agreement in the whole, but to demurr upon the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and obscurity of some Articles in it, and that they desired some explanation, and further explication; and so did suspend the confirmation for the present, but did think that at <hi>Newcastle</hi> or at <hi>Anwick</hi> some other Commissioners might be added to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:55301:96"/> those already, to treat upon those obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and that for universal satisfaction, they desired some indifferent place might be chosen, because they were a little appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive that their Commissioners were too much over-awed at <hi>Wallingford</hi>-House, and not treated with that liberty and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that was due to them as publick A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents from the Scotch Army. From the suspension of this Agreement, proceeded the safety of the English Forces in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> for they had been certainly rooted out of the Army soon after, but this gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time was to do their business; for they had intelligence, that many designs were on foot for their assistance, both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> which after a little time did manifest themselves. Before this time, <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> was come down to <hi>Newcastle,</hi> and had all his Forces together, but they were ill provided for Moneys, and of various Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and dependencies; some of them were of those Regiments that guarded and defended the Parliament, and they did not heartily come to the service: others were Creatures of <hi>Fleetwood</hi>'s, and they liked not to put the Quarrel to the decision of a Battel, lest <hi>Lambert</hi> should prevail, and give their Master a lift out of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; they did not know which to fear most, <hi>Lambert</hi>'s Ambition, or General
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:55301:97"/>
               <hi>Monk</hi>'s concealed Intention. There were many that had a strong affection for the General's Declaration, others for his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; so that they were a Miscelany of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused Interests jumbled together, and had not the same Ends; and that made them, though very formidable in outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, yet not considerable to discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing persons. The General's Army, though small, yet after it was modelled, wholly depended on himself, and all agreed in the same Design. These Scottish Forces did not with a brutish obedience follow the Authority of any, but according to Justice and Right acted their own Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; which was, To deliver their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey from slavery.</p>
            <p>The General had sent four Troops of Horse, and six Companies of Foot, the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest and most forward that could be pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, which still quartered at <hi>Anwick,</hi> and the English Army stretched their Quarters to <hi>Morpeth,</hi> and beyond; so that it was much feared, that an affront to them might have put all the rest into fear and disorder; and if they had cut off those men, it would have gone very hard with all the rest. The General, after great debate, sends order, That they should retire as privately as might be, to <hi>Berwick;</hi> and they did so, marching all night through deep ways: in
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:55301:97"/> their march, Colonel <hi>Zanchie</hi> did overtake them, coming with an Express from <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> who much wondred at the Discipline and hardiness of the Soldiery; and protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that if they at <hi>Newcastle</hi> should make such a March, he believed the Soldiers would mutiny, and knock their Officers in the head. The securing of this Party in such manner, though it was a kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, yet it rather encreased than lessened Reputation, which is greatly required in the beginning of Martial actions. Of what great advantage Reputation is in a great Captain, may be easily argued, for then Errors in them are taken for great Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, especially if they hit upon Success, which is sometimes the luck of some who are not of the wisest of men.</p>
            <p>The General sets forth the second time out of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and visits his Forces in his march, at <hi>Haddington,</hi> at <hi>Dunbar,</hi> and other places, as he went to <hi>Berwick;</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> now seem to part sadly with their old Guests, and expressed all the affection ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable; so that never Soldiers went out of a Countrey where they had been Enemies, with such high testimonies of kindness; and I think not dissembled. The Head-Quarters now are setled at <hi>Berwick,</hi> and the old way of Scolding and Expostulating-Skirmishes, continue; and the English Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:55301:98"/> press the General for to renew the Treaty, and desire to give all possible satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: to that end they dismiss the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners from <hi>London,</hi> and send to <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> with all haste for others to be added to them; and to meet at such a place as should be determined of. But the Scotch Officers answer, That first they desire to speak with their Commissioners, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they might spare the labour of any further Treaty; for they having debated these Articles, might sufficiently explain them. All this was to get time, which is always precious; but in this juncture it sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved much Blood, and secured the welfare of three Kingdoms. It is the greatest Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice to use all just Arts and Delays to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void shedding of blood, which God ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth; and he must be a cruel Beast that delights in such a savage employment.</p>
            <p>Some time before, the General had sent a Letter to the Lord Mayor and Common-Council, wherein he declares, That he had not neglected to give them an account of his Resolution (when the Parliament was first forced); but his Letters were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; and that he still continued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant to those his Declarations; and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taking notice, that the Authors of that force did assume a Power without the consent of the People first had in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:55301:98"/> To raise Moneys, and make Laws, and repeal them; and then expostulated to what end all that Blood and Treasure was expended; with many other Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Assistance: and because Religion was always to be had in regard, not for policy, but in truth; he glanced at the state of the Quarrel; That Religion was not the Controversie, all being agreed for Liberty of Conscience; but pressing them upon their own dangers, and of their Lives, Liberties, and Estates, which could not be secure under such an Unlimited Arbitrary Power: and enforced further their Assistance, That if he should miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for want of their timely aid, it would be too late for them by their own strength to assert their Freedom; and if he succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, it would be dishonourable for so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous a City, and so much concerned, that its Liberty should be asserted without its own help. These Reasons were beyond all contradiction, and they did much awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the City: for though the General's Sword had marked him with great Honour and Renown before; yet now his Pen doth much more; for (though it be a bold allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion) what was said of <hi>Philip</hi> the second of <hi>Spain,</hi> That with a Goose-quill he had ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Old and New World; so did the General, with the same Engine, raise and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:55301:99"/> arm the three Nations: for Swords and Power may frighten, but 'tis Reason and Justice that commands the World, without which great Kingdoms are great Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Robberies.</p>
            <p>About the sixth of <hi>December</hi> comes Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Zanchy</hi> to <hi>Berwick</hi> (where was the General and the Council of his Officers) from <hi>Newcastle,</hi> with further Letters to proceed to the Additional Treaty, and to consummate the Agreement; and withall, to desire the release of Colonel <hi>Cobbet,</hi> who was a publike Messenger, as it was alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. To the last it was immediately answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That <hi>Cobbet</hi> was an Officer under the General, whose Regiment was in <hi>Scotland,</hi> though now another Colonel put at the head of it; and that he came with secret Instructions to secure the General, and to debauch the Army from their obedience, and desired to hear no more of that matter. This Gentleman, though of no commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Principles, yet was of a great Spirit, and good Conduct; and wise men will not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily part with such Enemies when they are in their power.</p>
            <p>Upon this Treaty they fell into debate of the Agreement, and of further satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for the <hi>Scotch</hi> Officers; and for place, <hi>Anwick</hi> was agreed, where no Forces quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, as most equal; with other matters
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:55301:99"/> not worth the repeating. But about one of the clock there came Intelligence, That a Party of <hi>Lambert</hi>'s consisting of three Regiments of Horse, and a Regiment of Dragoons, with two Drakes, was marched into <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and that sixty Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons had possessed themselves of <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>-Castle, near the <hi>Scotch</hi> Borders. This was thought to be their purpose, to seize the Rents of the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> of <hi>Wark;</hi> but they were deceived, for the Treasure was carried into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and secured by the <hi>English</hi> Soldiers there, and safely restored afterwards. The General secures <hi>Zanchy</hi> in <hi>Berwick,</hi> to keep him for to make satisfaction for the breach of certain Preliminary Articles; which were, That the Forces in the time of the Treaty should not advance forward on either side, and that the Pacquets should pass free for the continuance of Trade and Commerce; and then the General is on horse-back by two of the clock in the morning, to visit the Fords down the River of <hi>Twede;</hi> and being very dark, and the ways all Ice, and up-hill and down-hill, we might well say we were set in slippery places; for it was God's infinite mercy that we had not our Necks broke, which I am afraid some <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks</hi> prayed heartily for; but God tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it upon the neck of their own Designs.</p>
            <pb n="162" facs="tcp:55301:100"/>
            <p>The General was so intent, that though we entreated his great care, yet he would keep a good pace; and by day-light he had visited all the Passes upon the <hi>Twede;</hi> like the <hi>Theban</hi> Captain, that answered, It was for private men to take care of themselves, but not for those that have a care of the Lives of others. And about eleven of the clock he took up his Quarters at <hi>Cold-stream,</hi> where a Regiment of Foot was gone before; the honest Red-coats did bid us heartily welcome, but the Knaves had eat up all the Meat, and drank all the Drink of the Town; but that they were such honest Fellows, we could have grut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched it. The General being lodged, and falling to his good Cheer, which was his chewing <hi>Tobacco</hi> (that he used to commend so much); but this was Cheer that would not satisfie our young stomacks: so some fell a reviling the poor Town, and vowed it was justly called <hi>Cold-stream,</hi> being a place for good Christians to perish in: others cryed, 'Tis a Market-town, but resolved if ever it was in their power, they should forfeit their Charter, for that there was nothing to buy nor to sell: At last they fell to consult, first to send one Servant to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their Quarters (of which you shall hear anon); and we went to seek our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and durst not be too publick in our
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:55301:100"/> Counsels, lest we might draw too many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter us, who were all raging against the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities of the place. There is no man that visits the World, but will be put to straits and honest shifts. Necessity teacheth Wisdom, while Prosperity makes Fools.</p>
            <p>All was safe as to the danger of <hi>Lambert</hi>'s Forces, for they were busie now in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland;</hi> so we speeded to a pretty Hill some half a mile off from the Town, and there looked stedfastly for some House, or Trees, which are always in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey the sign of a Gentleman's House: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we had rid far, we met a <hi>Scotch</hi> Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, whom we examined strictly what Lord or Gentleman lived near: this poor fellow was the Messenger of good tidings, and told us that the Lord of <hi>Hume</hi> did live half a mile off. We rid hard to overtake a Dinner (for Suppers were not with us in fashion), and found this Noble Earl, and free Entertainment; I am sorry I cannot remember the name of the House which kept so many from starving. We had all the Civilities of the House, and the Grace-Cup (this is the mode of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to say Grace before a set-bout of Drinking); but this was after Grace, and that was a great Dish or Cogue with two Handles, that would hold a good Pail-full; and I believe
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:55301:101"/> all we did not drink so much Ale all Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-time as that contained; but they told us, that several persons thereabouts would drink it off at a draught; and then we concluded, that those Drunkards had been lately at <hi>Coldstream,</hi> and drank it dry. We took our leaves, and were very thankful; but he earnestly invited us there to lodg and eat all the time we were in that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but we informed him we were men of a little business, and must attend it: and thus this day we lived. He that sacrificeth to his Belly more than to his Business, in the issue will starve both.</p>
            <p>Upon our arrival we attended our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, whom we found fasting devoutly, and (I hope) praying too, which made him prosper so well: He told us the good News, that he had sent to <hi>Berwick</hi> for his Provisions and Servants, with all Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, and pacified us. We exclaimed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the place, and said that there was great need; for here was nothing to drink, not a little Water but what was covered with thick Ice, which we could not break; but durst not cry Roast-meat, to tell our adventures where we had been. The World is so envious, that men are forced to hide their happiness for their quietness.</p>
            <p>That Night all made shift with what they could get; and some of the Foot-Officers
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:55301:101"/> who came not in such haste, had made a little provision, and so fell to their stores (for Soldiers, who are prodigal of their Lives, are never sparing of their Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses). The next day there was business e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for every man that had Wit to do any: but yet the sober provision for things necessary for life, is also no small business. We heard nothing from <hi>Berwick,</hi> nor like to hear till night, by reason of the distance. A new Confederacy of us in a foot-party, resolve ro cross the <hi>Twede</hi> upon the Ice, and to see the Ruins of an old Castle that had been long demolished; it was not so safe by reason of the way, and of <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>'s Dragoons; but nothing could hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us from treading upon <hi>English</hi> ground, we all thought that it was pleasanter and warmer, and the Air more sweet, though the <hi>Scottish</hi> side much better Land; and we resolved never to laugh at the High-lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that being at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> wished that he had the possession of that City; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked, What he would do with it? he answered, That he would sell it, and buy Lands in the High-lands. But this is a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row conceit; every Countrey where a wise man lives happily, is his own: yet he forfeits the reputation of Honest, that hath not an affection for his own Countrey.</p>
            <p>The Castle of <hi>Wark</hi> we surveyed, where
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:55301:102"/> was nothing but old Walls; all did won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the politie of its demolition, it being upon a convenient Pass, and able to have bridled a good part of the <hi>Merse</hi> (so the other side of <hi>Twede</hi> is called, which is <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> full of good Towns, and rich in the Soil, as almost any other part of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom); but some wished it up, for then it might have had some Inhabitants, and consequently given some Entertainment. We found it had been strong, but very small and incapacious for any considerable Party. Not far off was a Gentleman's House of some Six-score pounds a year (and that is a Rich Laird in the North Countrey), where by the interest of one that was a Relation in the company, we had hearty welcome, and a good repast, which kept us alive another day, for which we thankfully returned. For good wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, 'tis the least payment we can make, to leave our thanks behind us.</p>
            <p>But now <hi>Berwick</hi> had supplied the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and all was well by our return that Evening, where for six Weeks we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued. This is that famous Leaguer, where the General encamped and besieged (as it were) <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and brought them to yeeld to his terms. I think this discourse is as profitable, as to repeat the Expostulatory Letters and Answers, which
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:55301:102"/> were but repetitions of the same folly, and further to shew with what care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence the General managed all, that no Wants could drive him from his Post. He was of so constant a perseverance, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Difficulties nor Distresses could give stop to his progress in Virtue.</p>
            <p>About this time the General finding <hi>Lambert</hi> withdraw his Forces, and press the Treaty, dismissed <hi>Zanchy;</hi> his own Commissioners returned, who had Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for what they did, but it should not have been manifested so soon, which was the error of one of them; for they were to use their diligence to enquire into the state of things, and temporize with those vvith vvhom they had to do, and to have vvell informed themselves what Assistance was like to have come in to the General; to have spoken with the discontented Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and such others as were not satisfied vvith the proceedings of the English Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: but they were over-avved by the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council of Officers at <hi>London,</hi> and vvatched vvith the continual attendance of the English Officers, vvho pretended it civility; but it vvas cunning, to keep them from the access of any others that might encourage them into Resolution.</p>
            <p>After three days time, they made a full Agreement, with a reservation of confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation:
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:55301:103"/> but they did not well understand the extent of their Power, for it was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition of no possibility to deal o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise. Some of the General Council of Officers did murmur a little when they knew of this private Instruction, which was not communicated to them. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners cunningly threw the blame one upon another, but they ought all to have been excused; for that was no proper place (under the povver of their Enemies) to treat in; and such a business vvas to have been managed vvhere they might receive directions from time to time; and had they continued obstinate, it vvould have been their crime esteemed, and not theirs that employed them. And some of them do ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie themselves very vvell, That they did do their duty; but that the revolt of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Army vvas so firmly believed, that they thought it their part to make and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Agreement for the security of all.</p>
            <p>It's certain, that great good came by the making of this Agreement, but that vvas by the artifice of suspending the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of it; in vvhich time many mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ripened to the breaking of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Army. And it is also to be affirmed, that the English Officers could not have been able to have kept that Agreement:
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:55301:103"/> for no nevv-called Parliament (vvhich was one of the Articles of Agreement), would ever have countenanced the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Officers, who were inconsistent with all kind of Government, but where they might rule all themselves.</p>
            <p>The Commissioners are here to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that when the Navy, and <hi>Portsmouth</hi> also, within few days after did declare with the General, and the <hi>Irish</hi> Officers at <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> that they should not lay out for the knowledg of these matters; and when many Members of Parliament (whose concern it was as much as theirs) were never consulted, nor any else (which two of them deny, and that they did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult these matters): but this was the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of the English Officers, who thought that any Blind would serve to cheat Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Monk</hi> and his Officers: but in the Pit that they digged for others, they were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken themselves; for in this obscure Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with which they fancied to deceive, they themselves were ensnared.</p>
            <p>The General (though his Commission<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers did omit intelligence, yet he) held it with many both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> from whom he received twice in the week at least; but the methods he used were va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, to avoid prevention: He had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly Letters directed to <hi>Scotch</hi> Names
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:55301:104"/> at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> about Merchant-affairs, and also other private business; and the whole Intelligence wrapt in certain words to be read in certain places; other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed ways, with Washes (at the back of another Letter of no business) to be made legible: He had a Frigat attending upon the Coast, which brought it by Sea. He had several persons that writ to <hi>Newcastle,</hi> where <hi>Lambert</hi> lay, and so far without suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then secretly conveyed into <hi>Scotland</hi> by Market-people that went by the way of <hi>Chevy-Chase,</hi> out of the road of all Soldiery. He had several persons in <hi>London</hi> that would go to the charge of a Crown to inclose twenty Letters of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise-business, and Bills of Exchange, and the last of the inclosed, of Intelligence; and this was weekly: so that upon search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pacquet, and finding still Business, they would make them up again, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have the patience to search the last enclosed.</p>
            <p>He had several Messengers that came, as often as there was occasion, through by-ways, and not in the great Road, from some part of <hi>York-shire.</hi> And (for the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of the Church-men) who (finding him so zealous for the Ministry as well as Magistracy) did constantly give him Intelligence from <hi>Newcastle;</hi> they did,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:55301:104"/> when any matter was considerable, ride out North-ward to visit some Neighbour-Minister; the next went with it to his next Neighbour; and this came beyond all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and without all suspition, to the General: And the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> sent a Relation of his own Name, who came and went twice without any one's know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, except of his Kinsman's Colonel <hi>Charles Fairfax,</hi> and him that managed Intelligence. Secresie is the security of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness at all times; but in this Affair all had been lost without it.</p>
            <p>And among all those that were at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Clarges</hi> (the General's Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law) was the principal, who stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died nothing else in all this time, but to forward this Service; and had a very sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til way of Intelligence, which, let whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver would, read it, it could not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood but by him that had the Key; which was by one Rule, that the Officers of the Army would not believe, and so they were convinced of it, by shewing it. This is the first Method that I spake of. No marvel the General did so well thrive in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, when he spirited all with good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, which is the life of Business. To have other mens Designs in the light, and keep your self in the dark, is no small ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
            <pb n="172" facs="tcp:55301:105"/>
            <p>And he kept constant correspondence with <hi>Ireland,</hi> by the way of <hi>Port-Patrick,</hi> and frequent Messengers. He that puts for all, must have his eye every where.</p>
            <p>But we must remember now the Head-quarters at <hi>Coldstream,</hi> where the General never stirred but for a day, and returned at night, to visit the other Quarters at <hi>Kelsoe,</hi> and the parts about; it was seat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Center of his Quarters, and all his Forces so entire, that he could draw them all together in about four hours, the remotest Quarter being at <hi>Duns,</hi> and here there was so great security, that most of the Officers never slept more soundly, and without any apprehension of <hi>Lambert</hi>'s Army, if they had been as many more.</p>
            <p>General <hi>Monk</hi> continues at <hi>Coldstream,</hi> but full of expectation of the confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of many Intelligences that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: To that end several days of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like prayer and fasting, by the Forces were appointed, to implore God's Blessing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those means which he had used for his own and Countrey's safety. God was pleased to hear, and graciously answer: for though Hypocrisie is devillish and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive; yet Religion, and the Duties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, do miraculously succeed all Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, especially where they are maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in truth and sincerity. And as Religion,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:55301:105"/> so Virtue was very much countenanced by the General and his Officers; Swearing, Drinking, and Whoring, were only by their Names known, and not by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Practise; and if any such mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous Action did appear, it was chastised with great severity, and the person ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiered, that he might not (like a putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Member) corrupt others. They were all, from the greatest to the least, men of such Bravery and Innocency, that I would sooner engage my Life with Eight thousand such men against an Enemy, than with Twenty thousand Hectors and Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domonts, who having made God their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, every other Enemy easily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came them. What excellent Soldiers these were, Two thousand of them demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (in <hi>Portugal</hi>) to all <hi>Europe,</hi> where they saved that Kingdom, and made the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> glad to make peace, and own that Crown to be Absolute. This is no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern opinion; for Virtue hath always been a Friend to Courage: <hi>Godfrey of Boloigne,</hi> that conquered <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> being asked by a <hi>Saracen</hi> King, How he had his Hands so able to fight? Answered, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he never defiled them with any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious sin. And the <hi>Comedian</hi> assures, That a City was well fortified, if the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens were good men. Colonel <hi>Washington,</hi>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:55301:106"/> who was as stout as any, and had been wild enough in his younger years, used to say, That a man of great Courage must be very good and holy, or desperately wicked.</p>
            <p>The General keeps <hi>Lambert</hi> at a Bay, that he could no way possible stir upon the <hi>Scotch</hi> Forces, but with certain ruin; for the Weather was so extream, that his Army could not have quarter near us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out eighteen or twenty miles dispersion, and then his Forces would have been cut off in Parties: his Horse, wherein vvas his strength, could do no service for the Ice, and many of them vvere secretly corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponding vvith the General. They had not at first coming down, above one Months pay; and the General vvas able to have maintained his Forces above twelve Months, very near, in <hi>Scotland,</hi> with the Credit of his Officers, and the Moneys in hand received: so that if <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> had stirred into <hi>Scotland,</hi> he would have found many of his Forces to desert him, and the General to have great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages upon him. Vulgar Judgments are erroneous, who are governed more by Appearances, than Realities; and many whom they denote to ruin, in their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, prove great Conquerors to their amazement.</p>
            <pb n="175" facs="tcp:55301:106"/>
            <p>The Town of <hi>Coldstream,</hi> because the General did it the honour to make it the place of his residence for some time, hath given title to a small company of men whom God made the Instruments of Great Things; and though poor, yet ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest as ever corrupt Nature produced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, by the no dishonourable Name of <hi>Coldstreamers;</hi> that is, such as when all other <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> Officers continued obstinate to perpetuate the Tyranny of their Countrey, these men hazzarded to blood, for to lose their Dominions and Commands, for to restore their Countrey to their Prince, and his Lawful Authority: 'Tis fit for an Historian to write truth, and here is no danger or suspition of flattery, for I thank God I am a little able to do a kindness for some of them; and I protest, that when any shall want (as I fear some are near it) while I have any thing to spare, they shall not perish in their Necessities: and have not been behind with some of them already, to my poor power, because I am endebted for the preservation of my life to them. 'Tis neither Pride nor Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence to acknowledg an Obligation, and but Honesty to be ready to make payment.</p>
            <p>It would be no unpleasant divertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:55301:107"/> to know the State and Majesty of this Metropolitan Quarter of <hi>Coldstream:</hi> The Town is indifferent for so near a Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, the Parish is very large, and the Church is somewhat remote from the Tovvn, about a mile and better: 'tis said it vvas a Market; but I dare undertake to bring all the <hi>English</hi> that ever vvere in it, to svvear the contrary. It is seated upon the Banks of the <hi>Tweed,</hi> right against the Ruins of <hi>Wark-Castle,</hi> vvhich gives title to the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> and he hath great Possessions therabouts in <hi>Northumberland.</hi> It had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Religious House in it; &amp; of the <hi>Prior</hi> of <hi>Coldstream</hi> vve read in the <hi>Scotch</hi> History, vvho took some occasions, or vvas in some employment, to render himself of some remark and fame in those times. The most obscure place sometimes gets a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance from the Birth or Habitation of some famous Person, or the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a great Undertaking. <hi>Cannae</hi> had been buried in oblivion, if <hi>Hannibal</hi> had not there triumphed over the <hi>Romans,</hi> and taught them to secure their ovvn City.</p>
            <p>But the most peevish <hi>Puritan</hi> vvould have allovved these that lived in this cold bleak place, to have deserved the title of Penitents, and almost truly Religious. It is seated in a very moist ground, abounding
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:55301:107"/> with too much water both from the <hi>Tweed</hi> and other Downfals from the higher parts of the Countrey round about: but a true description I cannot give; for at that time there was nothing but Ice and Snow, and we could not discern which was Land, and which was Water; for all gave us the same prospect, and the same passage, with great security.</p>
            <p>The General's Palace was a little smoaky Cottage that had two great Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hills at the door; an Hall or Entry as dark and narrow as a man could not turn in it; the Rooms were worse than I can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe; he eat and lodged in the same; and I think his Secretary was his Chamber-fellow, or else he must have laid upon the Snow and Ice: his Bed was like a Bird's Nest, into which he was forced to creep; but yet it had so much state, as to have a Canopy of Boards over it: Curtains and Vallens were things never heard of in this place; and Glass-Windows were as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious as Crystal at <hi>Edenburgh:</hi> and yet in this strait Quarter his Lady gave him a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit; but in times of Business he loved not such Company, and dismissed her the next day, and did a little chide her for that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable kindness. The way to Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is to begin with Humility; the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son sometimes is the ready passage to a
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:55301:108"/> Throne. The Generous Hawk that tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers above (and as the <hi>Faulconer</hi> expresseth it), Lessens, and vanisheth; yet stoops for to purvey for a good Entertainment, very low. A Cottage is a Preface to a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace.</p>
            <p>His Chappel (for he was always unwilling to disturb others to accommodate himself, and would not take the Church from the <hi>Scoth;</hi> besides, it was a little remotely sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate) was big enough for a Barn; but that is no customary thing in <hi>Scotland,</hi> they lodging all their Corn in Reeks; so that this was used for a Cow-house, or worse; for a man could not tread there without defilement, but we were over Shooes and over Boots: all could have wished it more decent; but who can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul the Laws of Necessity? I think we ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved God as sincerely there, and our Prayers were heard and answered as fully, as if we had been in a better adorned Oratory. Some thought it was a part of the old Priory; but if it were holy ground, I am sure it was unclean, until some honest Red-coats (for now they were turned honest) were so devout as to make it clean, whose Devotion depended upon their Officers Command: and in this place we prayed and gave thanks to God with zeal and comfort. To serve God in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:55301:108"/> place, when we have means and opportunity to the contrary, is very cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal; but to omit the Substance of his Worship for want of Circumstances, is weak and sinful.</p>
            <p>And now you have heard a description of the General's Conveniences, what will you expect for the Knaves his Officers, (for so, though unjustly, many are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted) who lodged in such smoaky holes, that I think it was some while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>English</hi> Barbers could cleanse their Nostrils, though they made Brushes for our Noses, to imitate the Honourable Trade of Chimney-sweepers: yet this we must say, We did meet with few Vermine called <hi>Back-biters,</hi> for we had enough of them afterwards at <hi>London,</hi> which was an ill Reward for a good Service. To do <hi>well,</hi> and hear <hi>ill,</hi> is not only the Reward of Kings, but of such as faithfully serve them.</p>
            <p>The best Fare that was there, was lean Mutton, and as bad Poultrey; and the Ale brewed over night, and rich Liquor the next day, drank with good commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; and there was no remedy, for there was such a resort of Officers for Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Business, and some worthy Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nation, and among them his Grace of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> who w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:55301:109"/> a person so watchful for the good of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that he was but seldom from the Head-quarters. I shall always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the good entertainment in that place; and I have heard many of us say, That they never had so much content in all their lives (there is something in great Dangers that giveth more delight than easie Pleasures); our hard fare there, made us more merry than all the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Feasts of the several Companies in the City of <hi>London;</hi> and some of our Officers have since wished, that they had taken Board-Wages for themselves for those Feasts, which was not then, though now is in great and Courtly-fashion. To study Profit and Advantage, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver out of credit since the World degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from Virtue; and this Age we live in, hath not brought it out of request or fashion.</p>
            <p>One thing the General ordered, That Two hundred pounds should be issued out of the vacant Stipends, to build a Bridg at this Town, which upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval was never begun. If I had any credit with His Majesty (but poor men, and despised, cannot presume so much) I would be a Petitioner, That he would be pleased to confirm this Work, that it might be a perpetual remembrance of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:55301:109"/> Loyalty, vvhich might be a Land-Mark not ill placed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>English</hi> Officers were a little too unquiet vvith their Quarters upon the borders, the poor people affording the best they had; and I am afraid that they despised them so much, that some of the old Women there made them some Spell, that they might never have better Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of their own; vvhich hath too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily faln out upon most of them; and perhaps but justly: for, to contemn the utmost kindness of Friends, is great ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</p>
            <p>I vvould not have any think me so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to <hi>Scotland,</hi> vvhere I vvas ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by many Benefits and Blessings, as to conjecture that I write this in its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparagement. There is not in the <hi>English</hi> side a Town half so good as <hi>Coldstream,</hi> within Eight miles; and I think no man will be so vveak as to conclude, that all <hi>England</hi> is described vvhen vve discourse of some little obscure Village; nor that the Character of all <hi>Scotland</hi> is here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, vvhen vve speak of a bordering poor Town: for I assure the <hi>Reader,</hi> that in all my life I never saw more State, Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, and splendid Entertainments, with sumptuous and costly Furniture, and rich Pictures, than in <hi>Scotland;</hi> yet I have,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:55301:110"/> since His Majesty's Restauration, lived a Dependant near the Greatest, and mine Eyes have not been confined to one place. To disgrace a Countrey which is Renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the World, becomes not Generous persons, especially vvhere they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Civility and Obligation, and to that measure, that ever since they have reason to bewail the loss of a Happiness they then enjoyed.</p>
            <p>While the General kept thus close in these Quarters, the first arrival of good News, vvas out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> by the vvay of <hi>Port-Patrick,</hi> which was brought by one Captain <hi>Campbell</hi> (and by this good Message did atone for all the Sinners of his Name, and deserve highly of the <hi>Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streamers), That the Forces in</hi> Dublin, <hi>and all</hi> Ireland, <hi>had declared with the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; and such as opposed his Designs, were all secured.</hi> This was managed by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the Earl of <hi>Orery,</hi> an old Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of the General's, and the Earl of <hi>Muntrath,</hi> Sir <hi>Theophilus Jones,</hi> the <hi>Warrens,</hi> and several other Gallant Souls; but most of all, by the Friends of the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> though he was an Exile, vvho will always have a great influence upon that Nation, where he hath laid so many Obligations.</p>
            <p>The General was not much exalted with
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:55301:110"/> this Intelligence; but for others satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he appointed the great Guns at <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> to be discharged, and other signs of joy to be expressed; for he vvas alvvays a good Husband of the Publick Purse, and thought those Pomps and Ceremonies not to tend much, in an Army, either to any publick Concern or Advantage. Many of the Officers disliked the Intelligence, and feared that they should not try it in the field, for they had wearied themselves with discoursing and writing to the <hi>English</hi> Army; they longed to give an experiment of their other Faculties (wherein they were better exercised), in fighting out this tedious Controversie. Their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage was much commended, but not their Prudence. A Victory vvithout Blood is, as the cheapest, so not the less honourable; and this is a Triumph, and the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Conquest.</p>
            <p>The Messenger <hi>Campbell</hi> was presently dispatched with great acknovvledgments of their service; and desired that Sir <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus Jones</hi> might vvith all speed be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatched with six Troops, if they could be spared; vvhich accordingly vvere dravvn down into <hi>Ʋlster,</hi> in order to their tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sportation into <hi>Scotland;</hi> but aftervvards (as needless) they vvere desired not to march any further, but to return to their
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:55301:111"/> old quarters. When our own Troubles cease, we ought not to give our Friends any further trouble.</p>
            <p>The General, who always (though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ostentation) vvas truly Religious, sent to all his Quarters Letters to keep a day of Thanksgiving to God Almighty for this great deliverance and return of our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and he himself observed it at his Head-Quarters vvith a great deal of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Devotion. But before vve had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thanks for this Mercy (one being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvays an earnest of more) there came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, That Sir <hi>John Lawson</hi> in the Dovvns vvith the Fleet, and that <hi>Hazel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rig, Walton,</hi> and <hi>Morley,</hi> had been received into <hi>Portsmonth</hi> by that honest Gentleman Colonel <hi>Whetham</hi> (vvho deserved better for that service), had all declared for Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Monk;</hi> and of this Person I must take leave to say a little: That being one of the Usurper's Council in <hi>Scotland</hi> vvith General <hi>Monk,</hi> there was a great Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship contracted; and in pursuance of this kindness did declare, and was the only man that did considerably destroy the <hi>English</hi> Army, and remove <hi>Lambert</hi>'s Sword from the <hi>Scotch</hi> Officers throats: for <hi>Fleetwood</hi> sent down Forces presently to besiege <hi>Portsmouth, Breme,</hi> young <hi>Scot,</hi> and others, led all the Forces into the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:55301:111"/> Town, and joined with them; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards returned up to <hi>London,</hi> and resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the pretended Parliament. <hi>Portsmouth</hi> was a good diversion, and the occasion of the division of the <hi>English</hi> Army, which was no small security to the General's Forces.</p>
            <p>And thus this <hi>RƲMP</hi> gets into Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority again; where the <hi>Scotch</hi> Forces let them exercise their Dominion a little while, but intending better Physick for them (they having had Purging-Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines often). They intend to give them the Diet-drink of fair Words and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and some strong Cordials, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing the admission of the Secluded Members, for the fortifying the nature of Government. From the beginning of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army's declaring, they always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to subject the Military Power to the Civil; and to obey an Authority that was confirmed by Law.</p>
            <p>Upon all this, the General discharges any further Treaty with <hi>Lambert;</hi> inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, That he had certain advice, that three Commissioners appointed by Act of Parliament for the Government of the Army, were now in <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> acting by the Parliament's Authority; by which he acted, as his Army presumed, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for the same Ends; so that the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:55301:112"/> of his Army in a General Council as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled, did resolve, Without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to continue no further Treaty, nor to confirm any Agreement; which he could not oppose, because reasonable and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary; and therefore desired a safe conduct for that Messenger to <hi>Portsmouth.</hi> Major General <hi>Lambert</hi> lays his hand upon his Breast, and cryes out, <hi>That the General had not well used him:</hi> And this being the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil death of this Gentleman, who now fell from all his hopes, we must needs say of him, That he was a Person of great Parts and good Courage, and as fit for a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectorship</hi> as <hi>Oliver,</hi> and some think fitter (but that foolish Comedy was not to be acted again). He was close and reserved; but his great Pride and Ambition (to grasp at things above his reach), was his ruin. Some of his Friends are of opinion, that if he could have modelled his Officers to a dependance upon himself, he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken General <hi>Monk</hi>'s Method. This I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not contradict, and none can assert any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, because he was at the head of an Army, he could not govern, so that there was no opportunity to make trial what was in his heart. This pretence is much to be suspected; however, he had Wit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to know his own true Interest. Wise men often miscarry, while they that lean
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:55301:112"/> not too much to their own Judgments, but listen to good Counsels, arrive at a safe Port.</p>
            <p>General <hi>Monk</hi> provides for his March, having well disposed all matters in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> long before (this is to be known by their quietness ever since): with Four Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of Horse, and Six of Foot, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for his March into <hi>England,</hi> not knowing what entertainment the <hi>English</hi> Army would give him; for this was all the Force that he ever designed to oppose them withall: All that knew him, are well assured he loved not too great a State or Train; and this he made very evident at this time.</p>
            <p>Of the Horse, there was his own Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, commanded by Major <hi>Johnston,</hi> an honest stout man.</p>
            <p>Major General <hi>Morgan</hi>'s: this had been sinful Dragoons, but now converted into Troops; yet some turned Apostates.</p>
            <p>Colonel Sir <hi>Ralph Knight;</hi> this was Col. <hi>Sanders</hi> his Regiment.</p>
            <p>Col. Sir <hi>John Clobery;</hi> his was Colonel <hi>Twisbeton</hi>'s Regiment, and had formerly been Col. <hi>Rossiter</hi>'s; with him, and under him, accounted brave; but now degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, till it was headed and recruited by a gallant new Colonel.</p>
            <pb n="188" facs="tcp:55301:113"/>
            <p>Of the Foot, there was the General's own Regiment, which was almost totally purged of its old Officers.</p>

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:55301:113"/> have forgotten; bur all deserve to have their Names remembred at <hi>Coldstream</hi> in a Table, as well as <hi>William</hi> the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's Assistants in the Abbey of Battel.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Lambert</hi>'s Army we had assurance of Col. <hi>Redman,</hi> Col. <hi>Clerk,</hi> Col. <hi>Brett,</hi> Maj. <hi>Strangeways,</hi> Capt. <hi>Lilburn,</hi> Capt. <hi>Wilkinson,</hi> and several others, and almost of some whole Regiments in <hi>London;</hi> many of the <hi>English</hi> Officers were not disassected to the Design.</p>
            <p>These <hi>Coldstreamers</hi> were like the Nobles of <hi>Israel</hi> with whom <hi>Deborah</hi> was so much in love, and of whom she sings in the Book of <hi>Judges, because they offered themselves wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly among the people, and jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field.</hi> Danger was these men's Election; and though there was such a Presence of God accompanied them, that no blood was shed, yet they were ready to have spent to the last drop, for publick safety.</p>
            <p>They were like the Sons of <hi>Gad,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> that came to <hi>David</hi> in his great distress at <hi>Ziglag,</hi> that went over <hi>Jordan</hi> in the first Month, when it had overflown all its Banks, and put to flight all them in the Valleys: men of Might, men of Warr, fit for the battel, that could handle Sword and Buckler,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:55301:114"/> whose Faces were like the Faces of Lions, and were as swift as the Roes upon the Mountains. Such were our brave Officers, who made their Beds upon the Ice, and travelled over Mountains of Snow, to redeem their Countrey. Let Posterity ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate their memory, and let the Ages to come call them Blessed: and I pray God make them happy, even every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and private Soldier that was among them, and keep them in the way of true Religion and Virtue, and as they walked when I was with them, after they decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, vvhich vvould have pleased the most censorious: being far removed from Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, yet utterly abhorring and detest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prophaness: such are Christians that God himself is inamour'd of, and Christ delights in them as his Crown and Royal Diadem. This is all I can do for my old Friends, to remember and love them. I hope the <hi>Reader</hi> will forgive this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant diversion, and put it upon the score of Affection, which is a Weakness that this Age is not much guilty of.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> and many more Noble and Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Persons that did rise in <hi>York-shire</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the back of <hi>Lambert,</hi> are also, as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates and Assistants, to be stiled <hi>Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streamers.</hi> 'Tis no disgrace to the greatest
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:55301:114"/> Nobility, to be in the number of Loyal and Honest Subjects; which is an Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Order, wherein poor men may bear them company.</p>
            <p>And among so many Worthy and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous persons, it is hard to determine the glory of the one, without the dishonour of the other. With this little Force the General gave check to three Nations. <hi>Scotland</hi> was quiet upon election; but the Armies in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> (abused and over-awed by their Chiefs) were decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Enemies, till with Patience and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son they were reduced to their right minds, and undeceived.</p>
            <p>About this time he rewarded many with Preferments, as all his Colonels; and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor <hi>Miller</hi> he made Adjutant-General of the whole Army; and Dr. <hi>Samuel Barrow</hi> the Physician of the Army, Judg-Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, for their Services. The Chaplains that were then in the Army (the rest decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) were but two, Dr. <hi>John Price,</hi> an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and learned Gentleman; and this Relator, who was Preacher to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and then had given him Places of the best Pay in the Army; but thanks to God he enjoyed them not one whole year. While he had relation to this Army, there was not a drop of blood shed: for he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was an Incendiary to preach up Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:55301:115"/> and Rebellion, and thinks it is the Work of the Devil, and not of Christ's Servants.</p>
            <p>On <hi>New-years-day</hi> (a good <hi>omen</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin a New World in <hi>England,</hi> that is, of Loyalty and Obedience, which had been antiquated too long; and to bring a <hi>New-year's-gift</hi> to our Countrey, of Liberty and Safety) the General sent over most of his Foot, and the next morning marched over himself with all his Horse, which was on <hi>Monday</hi> the second of <hi>January,</hi> according to the <hi>Scotch</hi> accompt, 1660; but of the <hi>English,</hi> 1659; and he marched in two Brigades: in the first were the General's own Regiment of Horse, and Col. <hi>Knight</hi>'s, with his own Regiment of Foot; Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Fairfax</hi>'s and Col. <hi>Lidcots:</hi> In the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Brigade, commanded by Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Morgan,</hi> were <hi>Morgan</hi>'s own Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Horse and Foot, Col. <hi>Clowber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s Regiment of Horse, Col. <hi>Read</hi>'s, and Col. <hi>Hubblethorn</hi>'s of Foot. Our Foot were the best that the World ever saw; but the Horse were not so full, as to their established number, and had been haras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed very much by Journeys for to model the Army, and bad Quarters. But the <hi>Londoners</hi> were mistaken, who despised them because they did not look so finely, nor Praunce so fiercely as <hi>Lambert</hi>'s, that
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:55301:115"/> came against us. But these men were used to Shops, and not to skill or judgment of these matters: for if the <hi>English</hi> Horse that came against us, had had but the Duty and the Quarters that these had, they would have been half dead: but ours were for Business, and not for State or Pleasure. 'Tis not good to judg Affairs out of our own way. <hi>The Cobler mistakes when he goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his Last.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not to be imagined what Offers the General now had of Regiments and Troops of Horse to be raised, when he had no need (all will be Soldiers when Danger is over): but he smiled at these Addresses, when before in the bordering-Counties he could not buy Horses for his Money (of which he was in no want). This puts me in mind of a passage after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the Month of <hi>May,</hi> he going to <hi>Dover</hi> to receive and wait upon His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty up to <hi>London:</hi> He was at a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow in his Quarters at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and looked upon many brave and finely ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Troops that marched by, who were Gentlemen-Voluntiers to welcome His Majesty home to His Three Kingdoms: He looking upon them, and commending them, one stander-by told him, He had none of these at <hi>Coldstream:</hi> but the same person continuing the discourse (upon
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:55301:116"/> seeing a new Troop coming forward with Green Scarfs and Feathers in a Summer-gayety), 'Tis true indeed, Grashoppers and Butter-Flies never come abroad in Frosty-weather; and at the best season there are never many in <hi>Scotland.</hi> This was so much truth, that the General was well pleased with it, and thanked God for his good deliverance at that time, wherein he was in no small danger of all that was dear to him, the King's and the Kingdom's safety; and did then express his resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on never to forget those honest brave Fellows (so he called them then, and so they were) that sticked to the true Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of their Countrey in the time of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity. I do not remember above three persons that came to his assistance, till <hi>Lambert</hi> quitted <hi>Newcastle,</hi> except Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Ogle</hi> with his five Sons, with the two small Militia-Troops of <hi>Northumberland;</hi> for whose sakes I shall ever love the Name of the <hi>Ogles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the pretended Parliament was restored, upon the revolt in repentance of the <hi>English</hi> Forces in and about <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> Colonel <hi>Salmon</hi> came post to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castle;</hi> and informing Major General <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> of the state of Business; from thence he immediately took Post, and privately concealed himself for a little while in
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:55301:116"/>
               <hi>York-shire,</hi> and afterwards at <hi>London.</hi> What an uncertainty do we here see in Human Affairs! This Gentleman that but lately triumphed over <hi>Cheshire</hi> and <hi>Booth</hi>'s Forces, and came down with an Army able to swallow all <hi>Scotland,</hi> now knows not where to hide his head; and he that was attended by all the great ones in his Journey, and some of the Popular Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers that waited on him in his Stages, upon his way, with Prayers and flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sermons for his Success; these men had the impudence to meet General <hi>Monk</hi> with their Thanksgivings, though they had prayed for <hi>Lambert:</hi> A shame to their Profession, and a scandal, for which they deserve to be for ever silenced. Who would trust to the dreams of Greatness? or linger after the sweet, but deceitful shadows of Rule and Dominion, when we see so often the Ambitious fall into Precipices and Ruin? This should quiet us in an honest, though but moderate Fortune. 'Tis not an easie Lesson to learn to be contented; it must be attained by the Grace of God, not by cross Disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments. Misery may contradict, not remove our irregular desires.</p>
            <p>The General was marched before he had intelligence of <hi>Lambert</hi>'s removal; and the first night quartered at <hi>Wellar,</hi>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:55301:117"/> being the second of <hi>January;</hi> where the Quarter-Master-General, with his Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, had made all things ready for his arrival: It was not unpleasant to see the poor Red-coats wade through the Snow knee-deep, and through the Ice and Waters, which were in some places bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the march of the Horse; and I think they did not expect any great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances at the end of their Journey: but 'tis no small pleasure to travel to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Sun, especially when 'tis the way to one's own Countrey. To travel in the company of Good Hopes, is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant; but they march but heavily that expect no good Entertainment at their Journey's end: for why should any labour for nought?</p>
            <p>Here we did eat and lodg like Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which was not unpleasing to any: but not long after we were lodged, comes a Messenger post from the RUMP, with the news of their sitting; and that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned some of our rising out of our beds upon summons; it was an extream cold night, and it snowed very liberally; and yet there was no need of more: I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded we repented then of their return into Power, for the disturbance of that Night which they gave us. Their Letter consisted of about six Lines, as cold as the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:55301:117"/> Night; and told us how unhappily they were got together again: and because it wanted something to fill up, they put in Thanks at the conclusion. Let them have written what they pleased, none there would have given much credit; for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers are never to be trusted.</p>
            <p>The same Messenger brought Orders to <hi>Lambert</hi>'s Forces to disperse to their quarters wherein they were on the 20th of <hi>October</hi> then past; and his Message was little better to us, but that we resolved not to understand him. The General sets a good face upon the matter, and the whole Army was rendezvouzed in their march, and the Letter read at the head of the several Regiments, where the Foot stood deep in the Snow, and shouted very hard to get themselves in some heat; but they added, That they would go up to <hi>London,</hi> and see them sitting. All Soldiers desire to live at the Head-quarters; though it be most chargeable, yet it is a kind of Preferment.</p>
            <p>On the third of <hi>January,</hi> the General not willing to over-march his Forces, and <hi>Morpeth</hi> being too long a Journey for one day, he takes up in the mid-way; and here it was very hard for him to find quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for himself: but at last (hearing his Chaplains commend the excellency of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:55301:118"/> their quarters the night before at a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son's house (which is always their claim), he himself took up in a Parsonage. The Minister was represented to be an honest man; but either that was fasting-day with him, or else he wanted one qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a good Pastor, To be given to Hospitality. It was no Market-Town; the House was not stored for a General's quarter: so that some of us got Blank-tickets for quarters, and thought we might be as bold at home, as we had been in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and went in pursuit of a good house; we had not travelled far, but we discerned two; and like the honest Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that was offered two Livings (Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity being not then in fashion) he found in his heart to call at both, and chuse the best: but sometimes we mistake when we go by outward appearances; for the good Hospitality was at the other House, not at that which we chose, in regard all the Neighbours there convened; and among them, our good Friends that we went to visit. But this House was garrison'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we came, with a Foot-Company Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Soldiers; yet they being our Friends, gave us free admittance. The Gentleman and his Lady hastened home (hearing of such a number of Guests): they were bidden welcome to their own
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:55301:118"/> House, and were assured that we would trouble them but one night. We had good quarters, and contented with what the House afforded. This Gentleman was of the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion, and informed us, that <hi>Lambert</hi>'s Forces had quartered there; and told us plainly, He had rather they should have prevailed. We had learned so much of good manners, as not to be angry with him in his own House, or for his private opinion. But we assured him, Our General intended nothing but the good of his Countrey; and desired in him more cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for his proceedings. We parted for to go to bed; but going through the Hall where the poor Soldiers that had waded all day in the Snow, were lying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground, we could not but with pity look upon such Objects, who ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the best encouragement: yet how hardly do men part with a little contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution towards their maintenance, whose courage and pains maintains all that they are possessed of? Some great Kings and rich Nations have perished by this kind of Covetousness, and thereby enriched the greatest Enemies.</p>
            <p>The next night, being the third of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi> he quartered at <hi>Morpeth:</hi> in the way he was entertained, with his whole Train, by an honest old Knight, at his
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:55301:119"/> House, very kindly and nobly (I do not remember his Name); and at night the High Sheriff of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> with all the principal Gentry of that County, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended him, and they were entertained by him very magnificently.</p>
            <p>To <hi>Morpeth</hi> came down the <hi>Sword-bearer</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> with an Express from the Common-Council of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and a Declaration of their desires for a Full Parliament, wherein they might be represented; they alledging, that they had never a Member in this pretended Parliament, to represent their Renowned City. There came also the Sword-bearer of <hi>Newcastle</hi> with Complements and kind Invitations from that Town. These wary Citizens did not care for appearing thus publikely, till the Coast was clear, and they might address for the remedy of Grievances without danger. Unarmed Honesty is forced to deal humbly with armed Power. A pleasant story I cannot but relate to this purpose, which happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Scotland</hi> when <hi>Montross</hi> was trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant and victorious, and found no resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; he came down into the Low-land as far as <hi>Glascow,</hi> and had came to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> but that the Plague raged very greatly in that City; and from thence, by his command, delivered many Loyal persons out of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:55301:119"/> and might have burnt and pillaged that City, if he had been such a Monster of Cruelty as the Covenanters represent him. While he was at <hi>Glascow,</hi> many of the Neighbouring-Gentry addressed to him, and acknowledged his Authority; among the rest, <hi>Steward</hi> of <hi>Minto</hi> was one. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tross</hi> being routed at <hi>Selkirk</hi> by <hi>David Lesly,</hi> who came out of <hi>England</hi> upon that Errand, the Committee of Estates ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Commissioners to examine such as complied with the Enemy; and the Earl of <hi>Lanerick</hi> was chief, who was then Secretary of <hi>Scotland,</hi> a stickling Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanter (who afterwards avowed his Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty in Blood and Wounds, of which he dyed at <hi>Worcester</hi> in His Majesty's Service): examining <hi>Minto,</hi> that he did address to <hi>Montross</hi> as the King's Lieutenant, (which was then Treason) <hi>Minto</hi> confessed; and further, being asked, Whether he did not kiss his Cheek (a ceremony in <hi>Scotland</hi> to the King's Vice-roy)? This also he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied not. Upon which <hi>Lanerick</hi> cries out, <hi>Mark that, Clerk. Minto</hi> calls, <hi>My Lord, if you had been there, as I was, you would have been glad to have kissed a worse part,</hi> (he spoke plain <hi>Scotch</hi>) mark that, Clerk; <hi>to have got safe off, as I did.</hi> Upon which freedom, <hi>Lanertck</hi> dissolved the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and would act no further, and was
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:55301:120"/> very merry at the conceit. Submission to a present Force, as no more than is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, Prudence and Honesty both cannot decline it.</p>
            <p>Now began the General to govern the Army more Monarchically, and omitted all General Councils of Officers, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, upon the pretence of no danger or necessity; according to the <hi>Mode,</hi> to shake off all those we have no further need of, or (as its more practised) those that have need of us. But the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son was, That because those publike As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies were not agreeable to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, which were to be managed with more secresie and silence. Many Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, to publish them, is to render them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be accomplished. <hi>Metellus</hi> had good reason to say, <hi>That if his Shirt were privy to his Designs, he would burn it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A great part of that night he spent in preparation of Instructions for one that he intended to send to <hi>London,</hi> both to the Parliament and City: He chose a Person of whose Experience and Conduct in Business he had made good trial. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted him with many particulars about which he was to negotiate; but left all to his Judgment upon the place, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in what he should think fit, and to suspend the other matters, if he should
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:55301:120"/> judg them not agreeable to the time and persons he was to deal withall. His chiefest Errand was, To sound into the Designs and Affections of those in Power, and truly to inform the General [the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of most Publike Messengers is, to hear, not tell News]. In the mean time he was resolved to make short Marches, and linger vpon the Road till he had a full account. When we make too much haste, we often spoil our business. At all times Expedition is not necessary.</p>
            <p>The fourth of <hi>January</hi> the Head-quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were at <hi>Newcastle,</hi> where he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with much love and honour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing met with great multitudes of the common people upon the Road, before he entred into the Town, with great accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, and railing upon <hi>Lambert,</hi> and crying him up to his face, <hi>That he looked like a General.</hi> All these Complements were like themselves, who perhaps had done as much favour to <hi>Lambert;</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their custom to cry up Power and Success, and tread down Misery. But yet the General's Interest in the Commons, was not barely the advantage of his Greatness and Power, but his Justice and Love to his Countrey, which he did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways avow to be the great motives of his Undertaking.</p>
            <pb n="204" facs="tcp:55301:121"/>
            <p>Here was the General caressed and courted by the Magistrates, and all his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Soldiers by the whole Body of the People, with so much extraordinary kindness, that they were looked upon by all as the Patrons of their Lives and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties. These people well understood the Miseries that they should have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined unto, if the <hi>English</hi> Army had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed; for there was <hi>Lambert</hi>'s Head-guarters; so they had reason to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with their Arbitrary and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical Counsels and Intentions. And it was not here alone that the General was enterrained with the love of the People, but in all other places where he came; but of this sufficient.</p>
            <p>At this place the General sent away his Messenger with four Letters of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, To the Parliament, to the Council of State, to the Commissioners for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Army, and to the Right Honourable the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> who was expected to have been found at the head of a good Army in <hi>York.</hi> His business was not expressed in the Letters, but referred to certain private Instructions, with which he was intrusted.</p>
            <p>The fifth of <hi>January</hi> the General was received at <hi>Durham</hi> by the High Sheriff, and many other great Persons, with much
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:55301:121"/> honour. About this time the Soldiers at <hi>Carlisle</hi> seize their Officers, and secure the Town for the General. So also do the Soldiers of <hi>Tinmouth-Castle,</hi> who secured the Governour and other Officers, and brought them to the General; he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points others in their Places, and gives these Soldiers thanks, and some little Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment. We see how good Success is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver solitary, but comes, like the Waves of the Sea, one upon the neck of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and Vulgar Souls (though now they were in the right) are more led by Power and Prosperity, than by Justice or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
            <p>All this Journey the General covered himself with silence and darkness; and though he was accosted by many great and worthy persons, yet he kept himself at a close guard, and answered in general, <hi>That his Endeavour should never be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the good and welfare of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey:</hi> And the more near he came to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> the more he obscured his Resolution, as he did afterwards in <hi>London:</hi> That he and all his Confidents made it their great concern to refute such pretences; and he himself cudgelled some <hi>Fanaticks</hi> in <hi>York-shire</hi> for raising Reports maliciously; all to the end to lay asleep the Jealousies and Fears of the pretended Parliament, who
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:55301:122"/> dreaded nothing else but Majesty, and (that which would accompany it) their due and just punishment.</p>
            <p>As he came in his Journey, he modelled and reduced many of the <hi>English</hi> Forces, by his own Power, without consulting the Parliament, and thereby gave no offence; for they were such as had been his vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Opposers, and great Abettors of the Anarchy and Confusions of the <hi>English</hi> Army. He treated all the Gentry with equal respect; and did not encline to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Distinctions and Factions of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times; and by that indifferency ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged all to hopes and expectations.</p>
            <p>About this time the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his promise to the General) with the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and about Two hundred gallant Gentlemen, rendezvoused near <hi>York,</hi> and summoned it; and at the same time <hi>Lilburn</hi>'s Regiment (though he himself was a great Rebel), by the conduct of Major <hi>Smithson,</hi> revolted from <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> and drew down to <hi>York</hi> with the <hi>Irish</hi> Brigade, and others, who also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the City in the Name of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: The Soldiery therein quartered, willingly yeelded to the last; some Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Army excepting against many in the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> his company, they all dispersed themselves to their several
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:55301:122"/> homes, and he himself also. The Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral speeds his march, for fear the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> should be over-laid by <hi>Lambert</hi>'s Forces: but he had soon an accompt that all dangers of that kind was over.</p>
            <p>In <hi>York-shire</hi> the General was kindly received, and the High Sheriff met him between <hi>Allerton</hi> and <hi>Topcliff,</hi> and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others of the Gentry; and arriving at <hi>York,</hi> he continued there five days, and had very secret and private conference with the Lord <hi>Fairfax.</hi> He modelled <hi>Lilburn</hi>'s Regiment, and made <hi>Smithson</hi> Colonel; and <hi>Lambert</hi>'s Regiment of Horse, which he gave to <hi>Bethell.</hi> And now the General leaves his Forces at great distan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for the ease of the Countrey, and makes no Marches till he was well inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the state of things at <hi>London;</hi> where, to balance the General's Greatness and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity, they employed, and secretly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured <hi>Fleetwood</hi>'s and <hi>Lambert</hi>'s Officers. Men ambitious and greedy of unjust Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, will make use of any Tools to keep themselves up in Power.</p>
            <p>After a tedious and dangerous Journey by night and day, through <hi>Lambert</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my (to many of whom, General <hi>Monk</hi>'s Messenger was well known to have been a great Incendiary, as they called him), with repeated hazards of his life, riding through
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:55301:123"/> those Troops and Companies that were dispersing to their old Quarters; and this by reason of many of the Officers that deserted the General in <hi>Scotland</hi> in their comyany. The way was very bad, covered with great drifts of Snow, and such diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in the Road, that the Post-guides often misled their way, and were many hourswading in those long and dark nights.</p>
            <p>At <hi>York</hi> he found the City in the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Parliament-Soldiers; and the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> retired (sick of the Gout, as he was not well before, yet would not break his word) to his own House, and the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> posted away to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and all their Party dispersed. He sent for Mr. <hi>Bowles</hi> (one to whom the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> trusted all these matters) and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to him the Letter of Credit, and informed him of many matters that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the mutual engagement betwixt the General and the Lord <hi>Fairfax;</hi> but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Affairs were in such a posture, he su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spended the rest, telling him, that shortly the General would visit the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> and give him a better account himself; and he had great businesses trusted with him, at <hi>London</hi> to be transacted, and cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved llberty to be excused for his non-at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance: Which Mr. <hi>Bowles</hi> not only approved, but directed. To negotiate with
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:55301:123"/> them that can only discourse business, and are not in power or capacity to do any, is but to lose time.</p>
            <p>At last he arrives at <hi>London;</hi> within few miles whereof, he meets one <hi>Tomson,</hi> that was Auditor-General to the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army, and one that had resided in <hi>London</hi> all the time of this difference, and that was a true Friend to the General, and that had kept a constant and frequent correspondence with him, and now was posting to meet him; with whom he spent an hour for his information in the state of affairs, and the inclinations of the chief persons then in Power, and so parted. To be well instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the inclinations of those with whom we are to deal, is no small advantage in a Negotiation.</p>
            <p>After his arrival at <hi>London,</hi> he further advised with the most trusty and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing Friends of the General, from whom he might receive the best Counsel and Advice to manage that important Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation that the General hast trusted him withall, for his best security. The next day he attended the House, and produced his Letter to the Speaker, and was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called in, and introduced by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant at Arms with his Mace, to the Barr, to know his Errand, which was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in the Letter, but referred to his
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:55301:124"/> Report; the substance whereof was, That the Gentleman (the Bearer) had been highly instrumental in that Service, in the setling and spiriting the Army into obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and all other Business there tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacted; and that he was sent up by him (with the consent of the Officers) to give them an account, and to make such fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proposals as might conduce to the publike safety of those Forces, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to give him credit. He first deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Copy of a Letter from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Council of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and a Copy of the General's Letter in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; with further information, That the General did not, nor would keep any correspondence but what was for their Service; and this was to prevent all Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies. He that treats an Enemy, loseth nothing by ingratiating; and these were seeming-Friends.</p>
            <p>Upon this, the House took time to read these Letters; and then he was brought in again, and required to deliver a certain <hi>Declaration</hi> of the Common-Council, which was mentioned as an enclosed. And to this he replies, That it was omitted in the return; but he knew it was to be sold in the <hi>Stationers</hi> Shops; and he believed that they had most of them seen it. Then he was commanded to proceed to what
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:55301:124"/> he had further from the General. Who told them, That he was commanded to let them know the great Affections of their <hi>Scottish</hi> Army: That all the Soldiers did (upon the arrival of their Messenger with the tidings of their return to their Power and Authority) express great joy, with very loud Acclamations, and desired to come up to see them in that Power; and declared the great Resolution and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of those Forces, that notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Difficulties and Discouragements, continued firm and constant. He had also in particular from the General Council of their Officers, to tender their best Services, and humble Entreaties withall, That they would not employ nor trust persons of seditious and unsetled Principles, either in their Armies, Countrey-Militia, Fleets, or in any other Places of Authority; having found by experience the giddiness and inconstancy of such, and their unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to submit to any kind of Government: but, that men of sober and sound Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and moderate in their Opinions and Professions, might be encouraged and countenanced, as those, who in this great Contest, had manifested most affection to the true Interest of their Countrey. This was to put some stop to their haste in their modelling of the Army with Persons who
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:55301:125"/> had been Confederates with <hi>Lambert</hi> and <hi>Fleetwood.</hi> 'Tis easier and surer to hinder a Mischief, than afterwards to remedy it.</p>
            <p>That the General did recommend to them rhe countenancing and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an Able and Learned Ministry; and that due Maintenance and Favour might be shewn to the Universities, and other Schools of good Learning: That it was a great scandal to the Nation, that so many Mechanick persons did intrude upon the Office and Function of the Preachers of the Gospel: That the <hi>Scottish</hi> Nation had very particularly obliged him in this action; and that he had received great as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance and encouragement from them; and desired that they would take it into their consideration, that some acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment might be made by them to that Nation; especially that they might be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured in all their just Rights, and protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the future from all Oppressions and Exactions, and enjoy all Priviledges with the <hi>English,</hi> which they had upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion well deserved. That because for a long time there had been no Civil Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity there, for Judicial Proceedings, that they would take care to speed down Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners and Judges for the publike peace and security of that Countrey. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member those that shewed us kindness in
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:55301:125"/> times of Necessity, is a Virtue not much practised, yet always commended.</p>
            <p>And because all the Officers of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who had done bravely, and deserved very well from them, had no other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions but from himself (who had not full Power), he desired their confirmation from them; and particularly, did recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to them the Services of Sir <hi>Thomas Morgan,</hi> his Major General, and some others, who did come to him in a time of great extremity, and did special Service, for which he deserved their best Favours. He desired an Act of Indempnity for all the General had acted or done in that Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking: With some other matters, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he dealt very freely, and then withdrew. And being called afterwards in again, they enquired, Whether he had any thing more to communicate unto them? He informed them, That he had many other matters which he was directed to propose to the Council of State, and the Commissioners of the Army. And being fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther required, To deliver the names of such persons as were fit in the General's opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be Commissioners and Judges in <hi>Scotland,</hi> if he had Instructions so to do: And in obedience he did deliver a Paper of their Names. Being asked, Where the General was then quartered? He answered,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:55301:126"/> That he left him at <hi>Newcastle,</hi> but that night marching to <hi>Durham.</hi> And then he had dismission from attendance any further that day. This pretended <hi>Parliament</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dared to trust, nor yet openly distrust the General, and perhaps they had reason.</p>
            <p>The same Night he attended the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of State, and sent in his Letter, and waited with great Patience till after twelve of the Clock at night, and never was called. But at last he was directed to go to a private Lodging, and there to stay till their leisure. And afterwards a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the Council came rather to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine him, than to hear any Proposals from him. And he refused to give any An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to their Questions; but let them know, That he was employed with a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Trust from those who had restored them; and if he might be admitted to a full Council sitting, he would deliver those matters wherewith he was intrusted. They had heard too many Documents in the morning in the House, and were unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to hear any more. He told them, That he had journeyed night and day for sometime, and was not now in a condition to resolve all their Doubts and Fears, and knew not where he should lodg that night; and in truth, was hardly straitned to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass a Bed at that time, if a <hi>Scotch</hi> Friend
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:55301:126"/> in <hi>Kingstreet</hi> had not supplied him. These People were resolved to disoblige all the World. Their great apprehension was, That General <hi>Monk</hi> was for the King; and upon this they much insisted. But he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, That he was not acquainted with such matters, and believed it was a sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion of their own Jealousies and Fears: And so took his leave for that night, and promised to give them attendance next morning. These men wanted neither di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence nor cunning; but when God's time was come to deliver us, he ensnared them in their own Councils, and set them against one another.</p>
            <p>Immediately he dispatched an Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the General, That he should not trust to those persons with whom he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>responded, for they were not his Friends; and that he should keep his Forces near him, or else he was in great danger. This Advice he took care to send privately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed, that it might pass without suspition. When they began to publish their Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, vvhich they pretended were upon very great Intelligences grounded, of his inclination to the King's Party, it was time for him to secure that Interest which he intended to serve.</p>
            <p>The next morning he addressed himself again; but then they desired him to go
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:55301:127"/> with them to <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> who was at <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingford-House.</hi> But he replied, That though he was one of the Commissioners of the Army, yet he had been in Hostility against the Army from whence he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted, and that he would not propose any thing to him; but if the rest of the Commissioners were convened, he would attend them, though he were present, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he would perform the Commands he had received from his Superiors: And these were the governing-persons, the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurers,</hi> to whom he made no further Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</p>
            <p>This Messenger applies himself to many particular Members of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and was with them at several Meetings and Conferences, and was informed of the state of their Affairs, and appointed to be at the <hi>Speaker</hi>'s Lodgings on the next <hi>Sunday</hi> after; where all the <hi>Lawyers</hi> of the House, and men amongst them that had any spark of Honour or Honesty, met; and hearing his Narrative, were well satisfied with the General's proceedings, and promised to satisfie all his Desires. Which were only such as might satisfie the Nation.</p>
            <p>Then he was resolved to return to the General with the <hi>Speaker</hi>'s License; and the next morning early he took Coach, and went privately to the first Stage, and there
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:55301:127"/> took Post to speed to the General; and he rode to <hi>Tuckford,</hi> very near the borders of <hi>York-shire,</hi> before he heard that there was such a Person living; but then he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Intelligence, That the General was at <hi>Mansfield</hi> in <hi>Nottingham-shire,</hi> where he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in the night; and before he had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed himself to give an account of his Business to the General, an Express follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, to certifie where the General's Quarters were.</p>
            <p>And though he had spent but three days in <hi>London,</hi> yet pursuing the good Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the General, he returned with this Account: That there were great Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies in the minds of many of his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Friends, that by some dark expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons it might be judged, that he was betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by those that had insinuated into his Counsels, and that had kept a secret cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence with his Enemies, in the times of danger, to provide security for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. That the prevailing and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Interest in the <hi>Parliament,</hi> was redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into the hands of a few and inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable persons; for those that had any Power or Influence, had been courted into <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Service, and others joined with the <hi>Committee of Safety,</hi> who were all looked upon with scorn, as Apostates and Revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the <hi>Good Old Cause,</hi> and that
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:55301:128"/> they were much divided among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>Division is always the Preamble of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; and these Scraps of a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> had not been easily devoured, if they had not been scattered into many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests and Factions: the Assuming part of the House were either Hare-brain'd and Hot-headed Fools, or obscure and disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded Knaves: That the whole Nation was absolutely determined to rush into Blood, and all manner of hazzards, rather than to submit to their Rule and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that principally from their great affection to the King's Family, to which some of the <hi>Parliament</hi> were so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily perswaded that he vvas incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that no Arguments could dispute them out of those Fears; and that they vvould vvillingly set <hi>Lambert</hi> at the head of their Army again, for to balance him. And had done it, if they had had time and opportunity, and sent them to fight the General in his passage to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there vvas another reason of the universal aversion of the People from that old and odious Tyranny, That most of the chief Nobility and Gentry in all the Counties of <hi>England,</hi> had confederated together in Sir <hi>George Booth</hi>'s Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but vvere betrayed by some persons
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:55301:128"/> employed; and that the RUMP vvas purposed to forfeit them all; which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them all very resolute against that unjust Authority that would establish it self in their ruin. And this was very certain; for this person did see a List of many of the best Estated-men in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> both in City and Countrey, whom they resolved to undo. This was no small advantage to the General's proceedings; for thereby he was sure of great As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance.</p>
            <p>He also had conference, at Sir <hi>John Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binson</hi>'s House, with many principal Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens there convened by Sir <hi>John,</hi> who all were Expectants of Deliverance from the General, and assured both the Hands and Hearts of all their Fellow-Citizens to join with him; and that neither Men or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney should be wanting, if he would but as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist them in the restauration of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties. To whom he had given assurance in his Name, That the General would do their business, if they would give him time, and not make such haste; and for this he craved pardon, because he was not instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hold any such Conference.</p>
            <p>He further informed, That many of the <hi>English</hi> Officers who were busie in outing the <hi>Parliament,</hi> were in some measure of favour; and that he was the <hi>Great Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite</hi>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:55301:129"/> of the People; and that they did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect some great matters from him; and that he was universally cryed up, as the Patron of their Lives and Liberties. And, last of all, that there was a great Division in the House, which was carried on with great heat and passion between the <hi>Abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers</hi> and <hi>Non-Abjurers;</hi> the occasion was, That the House giving their new Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the new-elected Council of State, among which this was one, <hi>That none should sit in the Council, till they had taken an Oath of Abjuration, to renounce the King's Family, or any other Single Person.</hi> Half of the Members of the Council did refuse, and they were the honestest and most cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their number, and had great influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the <hi>Parliament.</hi> These were his hearty Friends, and were void of all Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie of him, with whom he might corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spond safely, and confer counsels with them, for they were enclined to be much gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his resolution; they being all assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the General would follow the most moderate Counsels, and never abjure; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an action not only dangerous in the consequence, but highly sinful, to swear against God's Providence. Upon this as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance they even readily promised to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Counsels, and not to dictate any to him. This Report found good credit with
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:55301:129"/> the General, because he had the same In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation from some others.</p>
            <p>The General had then but one Troop of Horse with him, and had sent Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Morgan</hi> back to <hi>Scotland,</hi> with his own Regiments of Horse and Foot, and some others that he had modelled in <hi>York-shire.</hi> He immediately speeds Orders away to Colonel <hi>Knight</hi> to bring his whole Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Horse to <hi>Nottingham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the next day, being the 19th of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi> he goes thither, and there stays some ten days, till he could get his Forces toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for which he sends Orders in all haste. In all places as he marched, he was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with the Ringing of Bells, and great Flocks of the common people, who expressed a great deal of joy, and was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited by most persons of Quality. This was a long Triumph from <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> Applause is the cheapest Reward we can allow to great Actions, which have been atchieved through Danger and Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty.</p>
            <p>His Forces were at this time remotely quartered, some as far as <hi>North-Allerton;</hi> and so he was forced to wait for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance: and in this time he received intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of the disposition and affection of most of the Counties in <hi>England;</hi> and the Desires of the People seemed to be the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:55301:130"/>
               <hi>Voice of God,</hi> they were so unanimous and zealous; and chiefly of those men who were the most sober and religious, who durst appear at that time in the discharge of their Consciences both to God, their Prince, and Countrey. True Religion is the surest Bond of Allegiance, and doth strengthen, not dissolve Civil Obligations; however wicked men have abused it to ungodly Designs, with wicked pretences; and others blasphemed and scandalized it with the imputation of the Nick-names of <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>Sedition.</hi> As if Hypocrisie, that affronts God and Princes, could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace Piety, that is the excellence and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of our nature, without which we are rather Brutes, than reasonable.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Harborough</hi> (the General making no stop in the way of his intended progress of Virtue and concealed Loyalty) <hi>Commission<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Court of Aldermen and Common-Council</hi> attended him, where they propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed many things in pursuance of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration formerly mentioned: but the General, who was now resolved for <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> did not listen to them, but prayed them to expect his Answer in the City, whither he was hastning. That was a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel at that juncture, where he could give such Rules as the Nation might receive just Laws from King and Parliament.</p>
            <pb n="223" facs="tcp:55301:130"/>
            <p>And then many Addresses from most of the Counties in <hi>England,</hi> came with great zeal and faithfulness: for though they did not thrive with their Swords, yet their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions with their Pens were not so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>succesful. And indeed, many men that now appeared, have arrogated all to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, who never durst hazzard; yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving set their Names to an Address for a <hi>Free Parliament,</hi> do swear for themselves, That they were the only Restorers of the King, and not General <hi>Monk.</hi> But the greatest Boasters seldom traffick for truth in their discourses; and 'tis not unusual for men inspired with Sack, or discontented with the denial of unreasonable Demands, to rob others of their just Glories: A Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony not to be easily pardoned.</p>
            <p>Upon the multitude of Addresses from the several Counties in <hi>England, Norfolk, Devon, Northampton,</hi> and <hi>Buckingham,</hi> were the first and boldest to require a Full and Free <hi>Parliament,</hi> having had Intelligence from himself, and some about him, of his just and honourable Intentions: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>City</hi> and these had led the Van, all the rest charged with some Courage, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the influence they had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their Friends that had Commands in the General's Army, to whom the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral kept himself reserved, and rather
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:55301:131"/> controuled than consented to their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses (as it was necessary for him). He that knows not the times of Silence, sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom speaks to the purpose; and will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver acquire the reputation of a good O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator; which he must needs merit, that could quiet and compose three Nations after so many years Rebellion.</p>
            <p>Now Mr. <hi>Scot</hi> and Mr. <hi>Robinson</hi> were sent down to meet him, and watched all Applications to him; yet he always ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed some of his Servants (or they did it without Command) to wait upon these Gentlemen, and to receive their Desires, and in his Name to promise his best Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to satisfie them. But though these Commissioners were sent down to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg his Services, and to accompany him, it proceeded from his own Friends, who had agreed with his Messenger to free themselves from these persons, who were over-busie in the House, that they might publish a Declaration suitable to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, for the maintenance of Law and the Ministry, which was accordingly pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished. This was the first step towards Sobriety, and an Alarm to the <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> that the <hi>Scottish</hi> Army would give no patronage to their Errors and Madness.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>January</hi> the 24th, the General arrives at St. <hi>Albans,</hi> and there halts for
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:55301:131"/> his Forces, which marched by <hi>Newark</hi>-road; and there was visited by many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of great quality, and by a Nephew of <hi>Marshall Tureins,</hi> who came on purpose to see the General, a Captain of so great Fame; who was received with great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility: And among other Addresses, the Honest and Loyal <hi>Apprentices</hi> did come with their Petition for a <hi>Free Parliament</hi> (to shew that their Masters had not omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Instructions, to teach them their Duties both to God and the King): Who were thanked for their so early Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to their Countrey, and dismissed with great respects. Beginnings of Virtue must not want due encouragement; and Seed when first sown, needs showers and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment.</p>
            <p>The General did with his Humility and Reservedness, so charm the Parliament-Commissioners, that they received no Jealousie from these numerous Addresses, but held him certainly their own; and his Officers, who did well understand the mind of their General, did use so much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, that the Commissioners Coach did never pass by the Regiments as they marched, but they made a stand, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed all acknowledgments of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as to their <hi>Generalissimo.</hi> This did not a little please them, who were vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:55301:132"/> enough: so that they satisfied themselves, and their Friends at <hi>London,</hi> with the relation of the excellent Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Obedience of the Forces that came out of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Wherein they did them but right. To commend the praise-worthy, is a debt which we owe them in justice.</p>
            <p>One story I cannot but relate, which I was an eye-witness to: That the Coach and six Horses wherein Mr. <hi>Scot</hi> and Mr. <hi>Robinson</hi> came down to meet and attend the General, he used to quit his Horse, and accompany them, with two other, in the Coach, whereof this Relator was one; and in the Journey these two, <hi>Scot</hi> and <hi>Robinson,</hi> sitting at each end of the Coach, upon some great shaking and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent in the Road, their Heads beat one against the other, and <hi>Scot</hi>'s Head fell into a very great bleeding upon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part thereof; which to stanch, they were forced to call for a Chyrurgeon of the Army, and to make some stop in their Journey, for his application. This was then observed by one in the Coach, as a Preface to some great disaster, Mr. <hi>Scot</hi>'s future Execution. Every Accident must not be scored up for a Prodigy; yet very often men have such signal warnings, that it were irreligious to ascribe them to
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:55301:132"/> any but to Divine Providence.</p>
            <p>The General made an halt at St. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> for the provision of Quarters at <hi>London;</hi> and so necessarily those Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that were there, must remove to other places: There needed great endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to bring this about, not only to find Quarters for them that were to be disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; but to take away all umbrage and jealousie, the General sends Colonel <hi>Lid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cot</hi> to the House with his Letter; and the Commissioners, <hi>Scot</hi> and <hi>Robinson,</hi> did as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist with their Friends, that the Forces that came out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> should be quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>London,</hi> and be of the Guard to the Parliament: And this could not be denied to the Restorers, to be their Insurers and Protectors. The obtaining of which point, was no small advantage to the General's further Intentions.</p>
            <p>Near <hi>Barnet</hi> the General draws up all his Forces, and there takes up his Quarters, and the next day marches to <hi>London;</hi> and in his march, about <hi>High-gate,</hi> rendezvou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses again, and then gives order for the manner of their march; The Regiments of Horse first, and he mounted at the head of them, accompanied with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners of Parliament, and several Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Army, and other persons of Quality; after them marched the Foot:
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:55301:133"/> And thus (<hi>February</hi> —) he enters <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> by <hi>Grayes-Inn-Lane,</hi> and so to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> where the Prince's Lodgings were prepared for him. Success and Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity are the best Quarter-Masters and Harbingers for an Army.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scotch</hi> Forces did not find the usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al welcome of the people, as they did in other places; only they were gazed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that was all their entertainment: Which the private Soldiers observing, wished themselves among their Friends in the North. There had been some little disorders the Night before, from the Soldiers that marched out to their new Quarters. <hi>London</hi> is a place that every one leaves unwillingly: but the name and nearness of General <hi>Monk</hi>'s Forces, quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all. Reputation in a General, does rout the Enemy at a distance.</p>
            <p>After his arrival at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> he is visited and courted with extraordinary respect from the Commonwealth's-men, and several others of good degree; and now all the Grandees will be his Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. A prosperous General never wants Relations or Kindred. Flattery and Insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation will be always the humour of this World. They invite him to sit in Council, being one of their number; whither being come, they tender him the Oath of Abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:55301:133"/> upon which he demurrs, rather than denies (he had learned to temporize with the subtilest of them); and replies, <hi>That a great part of themselves did refuse that Oath; and he desired to have some sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction by a mutual conference between the Dissenters, that he might proceed with the greater peace and content:</hi> Which gave some apprehension; but upon debate it was consented to. Great deliberation is necessary at all times, but especially in times of dangerous and unlawful Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils and Factions.</p>
            <p>They appointed the next <hi>Monday</hi> after his entring into the City, to give him the acknowledgments of their Thanks for his Service, in the House: And upon that day Mr. <hi>Scot</hi> and Mr. <hi>Robinson,</hi> with other Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, came to attend him; and the Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant with the Mace introduced him; where a Chair was provided for him to sit on, within the Barr: The <hi>Speaker</hi> did receive him with a very plausible Speech, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he declared the Greatness of the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the dangerous estate of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion till his appearance with his Army, which he compared to the little Cloud that <hi>Elijah</hi>'s Servant saw upon <hi>Carmell,</hi> which in an instant spread to the refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole Nation. With much other matter, magnifying their deliverance
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:55301:134"/> by his Prudence and Conduct; and ended with hearty Thanks, not only to him, but to all his <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>Soldiers;</hi> to whom, by him, they desired to have their Thanks given with all sincerity. The General was now in a place where it concerned him to speak with the greatest circumspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and suitable to the present circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the Time and Place, he rose up, and spake as followeth:</p>

                        <p>AMong the many Mercies of God to these poor Nations, your peaceable restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not the least; it is (as you said) his work alone, and to him belongs the glory of it. And I esteem it as a great effect of his goodness to me, that he was pleased to make me, amongst many worthier in your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, some way instrumental in it. I did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but my duty, and deserve not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive so great an Honour and Respect as you are pleased to give me at this time and place, which I shall ever acknowledg as a high mark of your favour to me. Sir, I shall not now trouble you with large Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; only give me leave to acquaint you, That as I marched out of <hi>Scotland</hi> hither, I observed the People in most Counties in great and earnest expectations of a Settlement; and several applications were made to me,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:55301:134"/> with numerous subscriptions to them. The chiefest Heads of their Desires were, For a Free and Full Parliament, and that you would determine your sitting: A Gospel-Ministry; Encouragement of Learning and Ʋniversities; and for admittance of the Members secluded before the year <hi>1648,</hi> without any previous Oath or Engagement. To which I commonly answered, That you are now in a Free Parliament; and if there be any Force remaining upon you, I would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to remove it; and that you had vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to fill up your House, and then you would be a Full Parliament also: and, That you had already determined your sitting: And for the Ministry, their Maintenance, the Laws, and Ʋniversities, you had largely declared concerning them in your last Declaration; and I was confident you would adhere to it. But as for those Gentlemen secluded in the year <hi>1648,</hi> I told them you had given judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in it, and all people ought to acquiesce in that Judgment: but to admit any Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to sit in Parliament without a previous Oath or Engagement to serve the Government in being, it was never done in <hi>England.</hi> But although I said it not to them, I must say (with pardon) to you, That the less Oaths and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements are imposed (with respect had to the security of the Common Cause) your set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement will be the sooner attained to. I am
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:55301:135"/> the more particular in these matters, to let you see how grateful your present consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about these things will be to the People. I know all the sober Gentry will close with you, if they may be tenderly and gently used, and I am sure you will so use them, as knowing it to be the common concern, To amplifie, and not lessen our Interest; and to be careful, that neither the <hi>Cavalier</hi> nor the <hi>Fanatick</hi> Party have yet a share in your Civil or Military Power; of the last, whose impatience to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment you have lately had so severe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. I should say something of <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland:</hi> Indeed <hi>Ireland</hi> is in an ill-setled condition, and made worse by your interruptions, which prevented the passing an Act for the settlement of the Estates of Adventurers and Soldiers there, which I heard you intended to have done in a few days; and I presume it will be now quickly done, being so necessary at this time, when the wants of the Commonwealth call for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies: and people will unwillingly pay Taxes for those Estates, of which they have no Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal assurance. I need not tell you how much you were abused in the nomination of the Officers of your Armies there; their malice that deceived you hath been sufficiently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested. I do affirm, That those now that have declared for you, will continue faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and thereby convince, that as well there
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:55301:135"/> as here, it is the sober Interest must establish Dominion. As for <hi>Scotland,</hi> the people of that Nation deserve to be cherished much; and I believe your late Declaration will much glad their spirits; for nothing was more dreadful to them, than a fear to be over-run with <hi>Fanatick</hi> Notions. I humbly recommend them to your affection and esteem, and desire the intended Ʋnion may be prosecuted, and their Taxes made propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to those in <hi>England;</hi> for which I am engaged by promise to become a suiter to you. And truly, <hi>Sir,</hi> I must ask leave to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you, To make a speedy provision for their Civil Government there, of which they have been destitute near a year, to the ruin of many Families: and except Commissioners for managing of the Government, and Judges to sit in Courts of Judicature, be speedily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, that Countrey will be very misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. I directed Mr. <hi>Gumble</hi> (whom I lately sent to you, to give an account of the Affairs of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Army, and to make certain Proposals in their Names) to present some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to you, both for Commissioners and Judges, which he did; but by reason of your great Affairs, they were not dispatched: but I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly now offer them to your Consideration.</p>

            </q>
            <pb n="234" facs="tcp:55301:136"/>
            <p>This Discourse was not over-pleasing to many Members of the House, who cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured it upon many accounts, but did not think fit to take any notice of it. Subtle Wits take their aim before they shoot their bolt; and without doubt, such indulgent language for the Nation's Interest and Peace, did not satisfie men who loved to kindle Flames to warm themselves by the heat thereof.</p>
            <p>The General was very popular; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his compliance to this Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, yet the people pleased themselves with some secret hopes that they entertained of him (and would not believe otherwise), which did arise from the discourse of his Officers.</p>
            <p>The pretended Parliament (who were hateful to the Nation, not only for the usurpation of their Power, which they obtained unjustly, and managed as vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently) were desirous to hurry the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral into the same condemnation: That they might do it, there was a present occasion which offered it self. Hardned sinners have so much of the Devil in them, and are so desperate, that they would have all others as wicked as themselves; and by this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality they project an impunity.</p>
            <p>The City of <hi>London</hi> expressed a great dissatisfaction to their Government; and
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:55301:136"/> in Common-Council resolved, To pay no publike Taxes till the House was filled up with equal Representatives. That part of the Council of State that then did sit on the 8th of <hi>February,</hi> order the General, with his Forces, to march into the City, and there seize the persons of the most active Common-Council-men, and commit them to the Tower; and pull down the Posts and Chains, and take down the Gates and Percullices, and there quarter till he had reduced them to Obedience. The Liberty and Riches of this City, was a great obstruction to their Tyranny; and it was not easily to be frighted by Votes and Orders: therefore the General must try with Power and Force the metal of the Citizens.</p>
            <p>They kept him that night till two in the morning, to prevent any new impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions that might hinder this Resolution: There were endeavours used by some of the <hi>Non-Abjurers,</hi> to disswade him, who waited his return from Council; but it was so unseasonable, that the General was got to bed, and could not hear any more than the bare Proposition. These Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors of State and Darkness had no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter opportunities than midnight to model their dark and rebellious Projects and Counsels.</p>
            <pb n="236" facs="tcp:55301:137"/>
            <p>The General next morning marches up into the City, and draws up his Forces in the Old Exchange, and secured many E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent and Honest Citizens, and then took up his Quarters at the Three Tuns near <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> where he issues out his Orders to pull down the Posts and Chains, with the Gates and Percullices; which do very much surprise <hi>his Officers,</hi> and they withdraw and consult together, and return with a resolution, That they could not give obedience to such Orders, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore offered their Commissions to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, with the reason of their dissent, That they had freely ventured their Lives for the Honour and Safety of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and heartily joined with him; but they desired not to disoblige that great City, which was the place of the Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of many of them; and that, if for their service they should be honoured with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the City-Scavengers, they desired to begin at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and make that House clean. This was earnestly pressed by some of those that were thought most inclined to the Parliament's Authority, by reason of Relation and Dependance; but most of these men acted Conscience, and not Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, and knew no Advantages to be put in the balance with Publike Good. Honesty, though it be not so thriving in this world
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:55301:137"/> as Time-serving and Flattery; yet it will not miss its retribution in a better.</p>
            <p>The General listned to this as the most pleasing Musick; for he was willing to gratifie the desires of the Nation, and act for the Restauration of Religion, Law, and Majesty it self, which is the <hi>Custos</hi> of both, according to his own Principles; but did not yet know how to trust many of his Officers, who had been persons that had been long bred up in that Warr against the King's Family: But they that marched out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> were persons of Moderation and Integrity; notwithstanding all the scandals that busie people, who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached them to inhance themselves, that they had neither Courage or Prudence to do any thing considerable: And many of the <hi>English</hi> Officers that had been violent in <hi>Lambert</hi>'s and <hi>Fleetwood</hi>'s Army, now (to ingratiate themselves into a little favour) turn Spies and Trapanners, to carry Lyes and Tales to misrepresent these Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and Brave Commanders; and I have known some well paid for this kind of Knavery. The <hi>Scottish</hi> Officers had been used to treat and debate freely with the General, and upon that account would censure his Actions with a <hi>Spanish</hi> liberty, but were resolved never to leave him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could they but to his ruin; but if they
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:55301:138"/> had been so treacherous as some expected, they might easily have ruined the whole Design. To wheel about three Nations to their ancient Religion and Loyalty, was a work that required many hands; yet a few then armed, might easily have overturned all; Confusion many times being the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of a <hi>Massanello,</hi> or any base Child of the Earth: but it must be a Man of God that can bring a People into Order and Settlement.</p>
            <p>They did expect some little share of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that when they had broke their Swords, they might have had a Spade to dig withall: but no matter; let these brave Spirits content themselves to rest their heads upon <hi>Turf from Coldstream,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main with the glory of their own Actions, which are great Rewards, and with hopes of greater in Heaven.</p>
            <p>The General pacifies them with all kind of sweetness, and assures them, That they should yet see all in a good condition; and entreats their obedience, with some dark hints of his own dislike; but he had Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from the Council, and he must obey. They persisted resolute; so that the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Officers were entrusted with these Commands, and addressed themselves to their Work. Destroying and pulling down, is work for every Vulgar hand.
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:55301:138"/> Devils can unto a World.</p>
            <p>Many honest and stout Citizens applied to the General, and did remonstrate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this proceeding of the Council; and told him plainly, That they expected him out of <hi>Scotland</hi> with much impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as a Friend, that might be an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Liberty and Security; but for him thus to use them, who were ready with their Lives and Fortunes to run all hazzards with him [Injuries from Friends are the most grievous]; that he should attempt that which the Usurpers in their greatest Pride and Ruffle never durst offer at. They protested that they would tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sport their Goods and Persons to any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the World, rather than live expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to such Dangers and Confusions. These were free and bold Addresses; I fear some of these persons now living, are not so well satisfied with the present times; but let these remember the unhappiness and trouble of those days, and bear with a little incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, rather than introduce a Mischief upon themselves and the whole Nation. For their Shops and Ware-houses cannot be safe, when the Kingdom is in danger: and whither their Obstinacy may bring all, wise men much fear, while they sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to Passion all publike and private Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</p>
            <pb n="240" facs="tcp:55301:139"/>
            <p>The General having pulled down their Posts and Chains, thought this might sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the Parliament; and looked upon the pulling down of the Gates and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullices, as a provocation too enraging; and had formerly learned experience from others, That none ever injured that City to their own advantage. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore intercedes by Letter to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That they would be pleased to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call part of their Orders. But they grow more obstinate, and vote down the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Common-Council, and send Orders more peremptorily to beat their Gates and Percullices to pieces; which was a result of their Violence and Presumption, not caring to disoblige all the World, so they may keep themselves in Power. They had been restored twice, and now think nothing can interrupt their Dominion; and despise unarmed Citizens, when they had baffled great Armies and Protectors. Security does always presage, and many times procure ruin. And see the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Human Policies! for this which they think would be their strength, did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celerate their destruction; and the pulling down the City-Gates, made the way pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent for the King to enter to his Throne, and to chastise them for their Treason. It is untruly reported, That at this time the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:55301:139"/> RUMP voted away his Commission, while he was so busie in this Service (it's impossible to imagine); so that the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral was used to say, For this affront of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing employed to pull down the Gates, he was even with them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the rest of the story is fiction.</p>
            <p>This Action of the Parliament lost them absolutely in the opinions of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Officers, who from hence began to justifie <hi>Lambert</hi>'s proceedings; and would discourse, That they feared the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would enforce them to follow his Methods. Greatest Merits and Services mis-placed, and requited with Injuries and Injustice, do raise the greatest Rage and Indignation.</p>
            <p>They did give obedience to their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and beat down the Gates and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullices; but in such a manner, and with such discourse, that the Citizens were scarce displeased with them. They told them, That they came from <hi>Scotland,</hi> where their Enemies loved them, and now they were employed to oppress their best Friends. At <hi>Newgate,</hi> the Officer that commanded when the Gates broke in pieces, took some small parcels of Wood, and gave all his Soldiers for the Medals that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament promised them. When they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared against <hi>Lambert,</hi> there was a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:55301:140"/> from <hi>London</hi> that mentioned such a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise for the encouragement of the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. The <hi>Romans,</hi> had they had base and penurious Souls, never had established Dominion in the World. It was their Bounty and Rewards that began and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured their Conquests; their Triumphs, Ovations, and several Crowns, and Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Trophies, that rendred Danger so despised. To set Death and Wounds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, and no Encouragement as an Antidote, is to bafflle Courage it self; and he that hath learned only Severity to punish, understands the first and least part of Government: yet this Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath rendred some Great; but such Greatness is not lasting that endeavours not to greaten others.</p>
            <p>The Officers in all parts of the City do exclaim against this Drudgery put upon them to make them odious to the People as <hi>Lambert</hi>'s Army was; and vindicate their General, That it was contrary to his advice, and against his will, that this affront was put upon the City. Many of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that attended him, discerned into his Mind; and to some he expressed himself freely, and was glad that they were so sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of the indignity that was put upon him. Men of Power and the Sword, will not endure Injuries and Blows: He that
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:55301:140"/> strikes, must strike sure at once.</p>
            <p>Colonel <hi>Herbert Morley,</hi> who was the <hi>Lieutenant of the Tower,</hi> came to visit the General at his Quarters in the City, and some of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Officers could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain themselves, but very generously cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured these actions of the Parliament: He was a principal Member thereof, and a <hi>Non-Abjurer,</hi> and expressed his dissent to these proceedings; upon which the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral did disallow these extream Counsels, as unsafe; and that such Violence would irritate the people to desperation. <hi>Morley</hi> took the occasion to assure the General, for the Tower, himself, and Sir <hi>John Fagg</hi> his Brother, whose two Regiments were then in <hi>London,</hi> that all were resolved to agree with him in any matters that should be for the publike Peace and Settlement: And here was the Project manifested (though long before designed) of giving this pretended Parliament a Corrective; which was cheerfully embraced by all his own Officers, who were resolved to run counter to their own Judgments and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, to serve their General, but more especially to free their Countrey. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian self-denial, which these <hi>Scottish</hi> War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours had studied to restore publike peace, lay down their Arms, and take up the greatest Earthly Cross to a generous Mind, <hi>Poverty.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="244" facs="tcp:55301:141"/>
            <p>The General intrusts his old Confidents to sound some of the <hi>English</hi> Officers, to take away all Jealousies from them; but those that were tried, were strangely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for a speedy dispatch; and that night the General returned to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> where five persons desired a private admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssion; where they so heartily represented the sad condition of Affairs, that it was concluded necessary to provide a Remedy. In times of necessity we call the first Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician that is near; we do not study nor regard whether he be in Velvet or Cloath; ordinary Doctors may save a life in extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; I wish wiser may preserve. It is a weak assertion to maintain matters never intended, because in such Prudent hands as they did not miscarry: A Maxim of Policy which Pedants and Hectors founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their own Experience!</p>
            <p>The General (after long debates, that point being once gained, <hi>That some method must be used for present recovery from this Politick Distemper</hi>) retired to his rest, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had but little several nights before, and but that day come out of the City; and so doth another that was there. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore day-light these four persons had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared a brisk and smart Letter to be sent the House; after remonstrating many grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, they fall upon this peremptory,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:55301:141"/> That on <hi>Friday</hi> next they issue Writs to fill up the House, and set a determinate time to put a period to their own sitting, that all <hi>England</hi> might enjoy their desires of a Full and Free Parliament. After this Letter, the pretended Parliament grew jealous, and looked upon the General as an Enemy; and now they constitute five Commissioners (he being one) to govern the Army, and continue his Commission of Lieutenant-General of all the Forces: so that they which so boldly affirm, That they took away his Commission, and that they forsook him, not he them; shews they had very bad Intelligence, and are guilty of great Malice or Ignorance: for there was an Act for seven Commissioners before, and all this was after this Letter, which did absolutely displace that Usurped Power. It is no wonder that men who are so wise in their own conceits, should be so misguided.</p>
            <p>This was signed next morning by many Officers that were convened, with great chearfulness; and sent to the House by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Clowbery,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Lidcot.</hi> The General had an especial Artifice, to seem to be perswaded to that which he contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. But though he was so sufficient for his own business, and loved none should meddle where he could do all himself; yet in matters of this nature, he was forced to
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:55301:142"/> employ others; but with an Art beyond example, he quickly disobliged himself from them: a Policy perhaps beyond the Rules of <hi>Machiavel,</hi> and which are yet the admiration of some that had read much History, and never had observed such dexterity and cunning in Affairs, as he pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised; which was, to make use of all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers for his present occasions. Some shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Politicians do censure him as a man not of that depth: their Arguments are as ridiculous as the pretence: What if Mr. <hi>G.</hi> the Stroaker was credited by him as well as by many other Wise men, upon the information of many, that assured they were cured; was this such weakness, to listen to the Testimony and Certificate of many persons who had experience? but he chose a Physician that was not so lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; if the Objectors had been in his condition, they would have been glad to have taken hold of any such means, so amply confirmed efficacious from many hands, and so he found. But Discoursing and Writing-Wits, must not censure Men of Action; for, like <hi>Themistocles,</hi> though he could not fiddle, yet he could make an unjust Commonwealth a just Kingdom.</p>
            <p>That morning he resolves to march in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the City, before the Letter could be read in the House; and dispatched two
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:55301:142"/> persons very near him, to give my Lord Mayor advertisement, and to desire pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of Quarters for his Forces: but the Lord Mayor was engaged in some pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like business; so that all that could be done, was to procure a good Dinner for himself and his Officers, who with other Consequents were about One hundred persons, whom Sir <hi>Thomas Alllen</hi> (then Mayor) heartily entertained at several Tables, and received a great deal of joy to receive such Guests. Never did any lose by Hospitality; neither do I think this Gentleman did at this time; for such Receptions leave a greater Obligation to the Giver than the Receiver; and the King did well reward him afterwards with good Benefits and Bounties. We cannot encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage good Hospitality too much. But good Works and good House-keeping did take their leave of <hi>England</hi> together; for the Ladies and their Pages keep the Kitchin cold, and the Cellar dry.</p>
            <p>The General marches all his Forces into <hi>Finsbury-fields,</hi> and there draws them up, expecting Rules for quartering his men; but the Citizens were doubtful what was his purpose, and looked upon them with some fear and apprehension; and the Lord Mayor was to learn the Office of a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Master, and the General was forced
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:55301:143"/> to come to his Dinner, and leave his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in the Fields all day; but it was his manner to be angry when he should feast, and his Soldiers fast: so that he began to chide his Messengers; but they excused all with the absence of the Lord Mayor, and the fears of the Citizens, to whom they had no Instructions to communicate any thing, till he himself discovered his Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: With which he was but little satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, thinking the City could divine his honest purposes, who but the day before parted an Enemy; and what further Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stility he might exercise, they knew not, but feared the worst. Good Intentions are not discernable, nor profitable, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out they demonstrate themselves by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and laudable Actions.</p>
            <p>After Dinner the Parliament sent his two old Attendants, <hi>Scot</hi> and <hi>Robinson,</hi> with thanks for securing the City; and in answer to his Letter, that morning they declare, That they were upon qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Members to be elected, and would dispatch in due time. Which were preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that he did not concern himself to make any Reply to; though his Officers were full of heat, and expostulated their Ingratitude and Unkindness: They and the Parliament made great protestations of the Love and Favour of the House to them
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:55301:143"/> all; but they had wit enough not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them; it being a Notion that they had learned in <hi>Scotland,</hi> Not to be too credulous of those that had deceived them so often. The General silenced all with a request, That they would hasten a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Desires of the Letter of his Officers, which was the earnest Entreaty of the Three Nations. His desire of a period of that Parliament, was a certain Introduction of His Majesty; and who can attribute this Infusion, but to his own sincere Loyalty? None of those great Pretenders (who arrogate all to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves) durst yet appear, the RUMP did so stink in their nostrils.</p>
            <p>He desired the Lord Mayor to summon a Common-Council, and that same which was voted down by the Parliament (which was a direct annulling their Authority at <hi>Westminster</hi>); and so accompanied him to <hi>Guild-Hall:</hi> which was granted with much content. The General declared to them his trouble to see what Affronts were offered to them by Orders from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of State, which he obeyed; yet disli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked that he was necessitated to comply with those Commands; but with a resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion always to run the greatest dangers to serve them: That he had not forgot their kind Letter, which he received at <hi>Morpeth,</hi>
               <pb n="250" facs="tcp:55301:144"/> wherein he affectionately concurred, but was forced to retire backward, like a Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, to make the better guard, and the more advantagious assault. That he had sent to the House that morning, That they should issue Writs for a Full Parliament; and to this end he was come to stay with them, and see his desires fulfilled; and that they should put a period to their sitting by the sixth of <hi>May.</hi> If Chance must be here acknowledged, then all Actions after coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel and mature deliberation, must be so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. It cannot be expressed what numbers of people were gathered together about <hi>Guild Hall,</hi> and with what shoutings and acclamations this News was received; so that there were Bonfires and ringing of Bells throughout the City: and this is the Night which was called <hi>The Burning the RƲMP;</hi> and I am perswaded, till the King's Restauration, there was never so much Joy and Triumph, and to the Eternal Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the City be it written, though it may be disgraced for Disloyal, by some passionate and peevish persons, who did not understand the Force they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been under; being freed from that Bondage, all <hi>England</hi> (almost) put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, did not more contribute to the King's Restauration, and with more affection explode these Usurpers. Let us all forget
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:55301:144"/> old Errors, and keep in memory these great and fresh Obligations. <hi>Flaminius</hi> having conquered <hi>Greece</hi> from many Usurpers, for the <hi>Romans;</hi> when they might have given Laws by the right of the Sword, at the <hi>Isth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian</hi> Games did by an Herald proclaim Freedom to all their Cities and petty Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths, beyond their expectation; which did so amaze them, that they could not believe it; but being published again, they made such shouts and expressions of joy, as are not to be believed: And thus did the Loyal Citizens entertain the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral's Declaration for a Full and Free Parliament.</p>
            <p>The Soldiers had kept their Posts all day in the cold; but now upon this news all the Entertainments that the City could give, is presented to them; Money, Wine, and good Cheer, is sent from every House; and the General needs not a List of Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, for every Citizen begs for some of these Guests: And the City did this night expiate all its old Mistakes, by so hearty and zealous espousing the King's Interest, which they declared (like the Tribe of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>), that they with the General and his Officers, were the first that brought the King to his Throne, and all others did but light their Candles at their Bonfires; though I know all the Nobility and Gentry were in
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:55301:145"/> correspondence with them, if not present, and influencing, for the greatest part. When the Tide turned, all went to the Right; and every one was for doing, the Work being done.</p>
            <p>The Zeal and Affection of the City, was so extraordinary for the King's Service, that no persons ever expressed more dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station than they to his Enemies. When the General went to <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> to speak with the Common-Council, there was such numbers of people convened, that he had much a-do to pass in his Coach; and in the Coach that immediately followed him, were two of his Servants, which in the night the angry Citizens supposed were Mr. <hi>Scot</hi> and <hi>Robinson</hi> (who but a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had parted from him at the Lord May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or's House, for fear of danger); these two did run a great hazzard of their lives; for often-times the people did come to that Coach, and enquire for <hi>Scot</hi> and <hi>Robinson;</hi> but the only Pasport they had, was to cry, <hi>A Full and Free Parliament;</hi> which was the <hi>Shibboleth</hi> to distinguish them from <hi>Rumpers.</hi> It is not safe to stand against a Breach which the Sea makes; nor against the Rage of an angry and oppressed Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, that hath newly broken the Chain.</p>
            <p>And the same night several Persons of Honour, who were in Council assisting to
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:55301:145"/> the General, and now in considerable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of His Majesty, coming into the City to advise with the General, the people cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Rumpers;</hi> and they had like to have been pulled in pieces, if they had not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken sanctuary in an Alderman's House, and sent to a Servant of the General. An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided Multitude was well represented by a Beech Tree with the top cut off, and this Motto, <hi>I am left in ruin;</hi> that Tree wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers when lopped. Such is a Multitude without lawful Leaders, even armed Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; they ruin more than they advance; and all their Plots and Projects, like the loaden Asse that shakes his Burden into a Water, is forced to bear it again, with the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of Load and Misery.</p>
            <p>None are so resolute as those that have been long oppressed; and these, when they get from under an Unjust Power, find it difficult to set due bouhds to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. The same Night the Populacy were resolved to pull the Speaker out of the House; but the General, who desired the Liberty of his Countrey-men, not their Tyranny; and that, as it was not fit they should be Slaves, neither would he suffer them to be Masters, and their own Carvers, but gave a check to such Violences which might introduce a dangerous Paroxysm in the Body-Politick, to suffer such Rage
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:55301:146"/> and Confusion. A River, though it be dam'd and stopt up, yet its natural course it will keep, and the Vent and Stream will go downwards, and at length it will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, and ride triumphantly over all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance. Thus did the honest Affections of the People, notwithstanding all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of Force and Power, return to their old Channel of Obedience and Loyalty. For the <hi>Persians</hi> were never more weary of the lawlesness for Five days, when their Governor was dead, that every man might do as he pleased; than the People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> were of <hi>Anarchy.</hi> Better live where nothing is lawful, than where all things.</p>
            <p>This Night he retired to a House in <hi>Cheapside</hi> to quarter his Soldiers, and to give intelligence by Dispatches to all the Forces in <hi>England,</hi> of the Promise he had made of a Full Parliament, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity and justness thereof; and that it was in pursuance of the desires of all the good People in <hi>England.</hi> And to prevent ill im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions and confederacy among them, he stopt all Letters from others by that Post. After mid-night he is to seek a Lodging, which might have convenience to lodg his Guards, which now were encreased, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate any attempts upon his Person, which the state of the Time, and necessities of the Publike, did render very precious, besides
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:55301:146"/> his own innate worthiness and value. At last he pitches upon the <hi>Glass-House,</hi> and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he marches; and that place afforded but one Bed for himself; and his followers (that never deserted him till they left him in his Grave) were forced to watch with the Guards, and remember their old Quarters at <hi>Coldstream;</hi> and now concluded that their Fortunes were either <hi>Glass</hi> or <hi>Ice,</hi> which will soon melt or break. 'Tis the fate of the best, to deserve and do great things; to receive, is mean, and an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Poverty.</p>
            <p>Within a few days he takes up his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in <hi>Drapers-Hall;</hi> wherein, with the House of Mr. Alderman <hi>Wale</hi> next adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he had all Accommodations for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and his Retinue, and good Provision for his Horse and Foot-Guards. Good De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs dye in the birth, if they be not assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Vigilance and Power; and he that means any good, must guard himself, and stand upon his guard against many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>In this place he receives many Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the several Interests and Parties, all striving for Power and Dominion; some to keep it, and others to attain either what they had been shuffled out of, or what was in their hopes. One would think there were something more in Rule and great
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:55301:147"/> Places, than Wise men find in them, that all are so greedy of them: But here was a great Change likely; and I think it was the great Offices that allured so many: for these that came in at the last hour, carried all; and those that had stood not only in the heat of the day, but in the cold of many nights, reaped nothing but the glory of their own Actions, which Posterity will renown; and 'tis but just to give leave for a due Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of such generous spirits. To be both unrewarded and forgotten after such a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, is very severe.</p>
            <p>The pretended Parliament began to see their own weakness, and offered any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions (and now the General might have had any terms, if he had not resolved for the Honest, rather than the Profitable); and they send for two persons, to whom the chief of them proposed any satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But they were told it was too late, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would content but a Full Parliament, and the people would not any longer be defrauded of their Birth-rights; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with great unwillingness they were forced to apply themselves to the finishing of an Act of Parliament for the filling up the House with new Elections; which they rather enclined to, than re-admitting the Secluded Members, whom they had injured so many years. <hi>Politicians</hi> will never trust
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:55301:147"/> those whom they have wronged: for Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature will meditate Revenge, though it come with its own Ruin.</p>
            <p>This was a various and unsetled time, while the General quartered in the City; and as all had their Hopes, so their Fears: It was like (for Uncertainty, not Cruelty) the later part of <hi>Henry the Eighth</hi>'s reign; where, in the same <hi>Smithfield,</hi> one was Hang'd drawn and quarter'd for the <hi>Popish</hi> denial of the King's Supremacy; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Burnt for opposing the Six Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, containing Doctrine absolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Reformed Tenents: Which made the Carter that observed both, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swear either. At this time the General was compelled to give Order to search a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick</hi>'s House for Arms, and then a <hi>Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>'s; and this according to the suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of many persons that applied to him. He was wearied with contrary Proposals; and forced sometimes (I fear) to give as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surances of matters that he was not able to keep. I cannot believe he did love to keep men in the Land of Promise, as Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners of Hope▪ languishing, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to perf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rm; but made good pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when he could, though it were against his profit; yet many that were led by Hopes, were to be cherished; who, like that <hi>Pagan,</hi> would turn <hi>Christian,</hi> if he
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:55301:148"/> might be Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> have Places of Honour and Advantage. In this, great men are to be blamed, that nourish Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicants with airy hopes, without any sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere resolution to do them good. <hi>William,</hi> late Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> hath a great Name in <hi>Scotland</hi> for his Frankness, that used at the first Address to tell men, <hi>That he would not grant their Desires, but appear against them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All Parties visited him, and all endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to promote their own Ends, either of their Safety or Advantage; and in this he was not backward, To send them away laden with Promises: and I dare boldly affirm, If he could have made good Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, he would; therefore for Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilities there must always be allowed a dispensation. Standers-by can easily cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and find faults; but had these Wits had this Game to play, I believe they had shewn blank; yet here was not such shuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling or foul play, as some pretend, who were losers at the later end of the Game.</p>
            <p>This difference between the Parliament and the General, did not displease either the King's Party or <hi>Lambert</hi>'s Party, both hoping to make their Ends out of it; and therefore they both fall to work with all activity. But the General was resolved what he had to do; but kept good intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:55301:148"/> upon the <hi>Fanatick,</hi> and listned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the actions of the others, resolute not to let the Honour of His Majesty's Restau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration be taken out of his hands; but he was to do it according to the <hi>Italian</hi> Proverb, <hi>Piepieano va Lontano,</hi> by such degrees as the state of the present Affairs would bear. Great Affairs require time to ripen them; and are not like <hi>Meteors,</hi> that make a great shew at the first appearing; or a fire of Thorns, which as soon as kindled, gives the fairest blaze.</p>
            <p>The Council of State did write often to him, inviting him to return to his Lodgings at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and to assist them with his Counsels. But he remembred an <hi>Apothegm</hi> of Mr. <hi>Nye, That he had rather be devoured by a Lion, than eaten up by Rats, Mice, or Lice:</hi> Meaning, To trust in the Generosity of a Prince, who hath Divinity in His Nature, and can accordingly pardon the greatest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries; rather than peevish <hi>Republicans,</hi> who never are to be trusted, after once grown jealous, without certain ruin. He was to act with great care and circumspection; and he had learned the Sea-man's practice; and though the wind of this pretended Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity blew contrary, yet gets as much as he could, and made some way by a side-wind; and for the present does what he may, not what he would, and waits for a better gale.</p>
            <pb n="260" facs="tcp:55301:149"/>
            <p>Great debates were before him between many of the Secluded and Sitting-Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, where the Officers of the Army were admitted; and many calm Discourses of the necessity of some means to Settlement; and there seemed in some of the modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Members, an inclination to re-admit the Secluded Members; but excused them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, because they could not declare their consents but in Parliament: And this was all the result of these Conferences. But the General having disposed his Officers to a consent to the re-admission of the Secluded Members, who had jealousie of the violent practises of the pretended Parliament, he found them very forward to join with him; and to that end two persons were appointed to make a final Agreement. At this time there was nothing to be gotten but Business and Trouble; but those that took Affairs into their hands, thought to have better luck, which some of them did in due time find. Several good Patriots did now appear with great Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Zeal for a settlement, and for His Majesty's Restauration; and assisted with their Counsels, and all other ways, to promote that great Design; as, the Earls of <hi>Manchester, Anglesey, Carlisle;</hi> Lords, <hi>Hollis, Townsend, Ashley,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pierpoint,</hi> with many others, who I hope will excuse me
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:55301:149"/> for not naming them: These did publikely avow their Loyalty in this time of Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. And the Earl of <hi>Lotherdale,</hi> newly released out of Prison in <hi>England,</hi> where he had been confined many years, was a very great Instrument in His Majesty's Service. Among many other that employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves in the King's Business, none did more faithfully or judiciously negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, than Mr. <hi>William Rumbold,</hi> who doth well deserve a good place in this Story for his great Services.</p>
            <p>The Secluded Members did usually meet at Mr. <hi>Annesly</hi>'s House (now Earl of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glesey</hi>); and the two persons they appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were the Lord <hi>Ashley,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Birch;</hi> where, after many debates between them, and those appointed by the General, it was at last resolved, That the Secluded Members should be admitted upon these two Conditions, <hi>That they should authorise the General, by Order or Act, to be Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lissimo of the three Nations, with all power to place and displace Officers, to model or disband what numbers he pleased; and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral of all the Fleets and Navies of this Commonwealth: and then by another Act or Order dissolve that Parliament; and this is to be done in one day (if possible) or two at most.</hi> The reason that was urged for these Conditions, were the necessity of
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:55301:150"/> the Time; not the Ambition of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, but the perswasion of those he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted: for, though the <hi>Scotch</hi> Officers were well disposed to the return of the Secluded Members, yet the <hi>English</hi> Officers did not well endure to hear of it: so that the same Post that carried the news of their Return, should also (along with it) of the Dissolution of that present Parliament, which would have amused or silenced all Discontents. The <hi>English</hi> Officers nausea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all kind of Authority; and none did less please them, than these their old Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, whom they had thrust out of the Saddle; and did much apprehend their return to Power, whose Revenge they feared.</p>
            <p>The intent of this Project was, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the General had modelled the Armies, and Officer'd them with persons of peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and honest Principles, to have called some of the most Eminent Persons of the Nobility and Gentry, with whose assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to have introduced His Majesty. This was judged, as the more private, so the more speedy and secure way of Service.</p>
            <p>They were necessarily also to appoint a Council for the Civil Government, and Writs for the summoning another Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the 20th of <hi>April,</hi> at <hi>Westminster.</hi> To these Conditions agreed, they set their
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:55301:150"/> hands, and to a very great number, even all that were in the Town, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers when they arrived; and so were ushered to the House by the Adjutant-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral (now Major <hi>Miller</hi>) of His Majesty's <hi>Coldstream</hi>-Guards, and accompanied by many Officers of the Army, after they had convened at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and had some particulars specially recommended to them. This morning the General return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Quarters in the Prince's Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and soon after to St. <hi>James's.</hi> This was not the first publike Action wherein he evidenced his Love and Service to His Majesty, by entrusting the Power with them who avowed themselves the King's Servants.</p>
            <p>Immediately after the Members return to their Trust in the House, the General summons all the chief Officers of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in and about <hi>London,</hi> to state this matter to them; and to prepare a Letter to be sent to all the Regiments of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the three Nations, and to certifie of the reason of their re-admission, with large assurances of their constancy to their old Profession and Principles; and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this Expedient there was no way to satisfie the Nation, or raise Money for the subsistance of the Army or Navy. This was chearfully subscribed. Money is a
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:55301:151"/> motive not more charming to Soldiers, than any other Professions of men: 'tis a very useful Engin in Warfare, and hath taken in more Strong-holds than all other Military Batteries whatsoever; which made one of the Kings of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> say, <hi>He did not doubt of a Fort if it had a Gate wide enough for an Asse to enter in loaden with Gold:</hi> And some judg, that the Victories of many, owe more to their Gold, than to their Steel; to others Treason, than their own Courage.</p>
            <p>The Secluded Members, after their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, did not think of so soon parting as was expected: there is a charm in those Seats, that few care for removing. But the multitude of Business engaged them more than they thought of, and their desires to be Instruments of His Majesty's Restaurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which Providence would not allow, because they found some <hi>Achans</hi> in these Walls, by whose Wickedness all <hi>England</hi>'s Troubles were begun and continued. But Charity, and the King's Laws, oblige us to Oblivion; and we shall never be Happy, till we forget our old Unhappiness.</p>
            <p>They presently made an Act to consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the General Captain General of all the Land-Forces; and Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> now Earl of <hi>Sandwich,</hi> they joined with him at Sea, constituting both Generals with
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:55301:151"/> equal Authority. And now, being qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Power, he began the modelling of the Army. He might very justly have quarrelled this, as contrary to Agreement: but he cared not for grasping more Power than what might conduce to Publick Good.</p>
            <p>First, by the earnest perswasion of his Friends, he settles a Life-Guard of Horse, consisting of Two hundred Gentlemen (for at this time the Publick Security and Peace was very much bound up in his Life and Welfare); the Command of these was given to Captain <hi>Philip Howard,</hi> a Noble Person; and to his Kinsman, Mr. <hi>Henry Monk,</hi> he gave a good Command in this Troop, which he retains to this day; a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and worthy Gentleman: and Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Rich</hi> his Regiment of Horse, in which some Troops were a little unquiet, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed to Colonel <hi>Inglesby;</hi> and changed many of the other Officers. Many little Changes must be made to make way for a great one. <hi>Disborough</hi>'s Regiment to Mr. <hi>Howard of Naworth,</hi> now Earl of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisle,</hi> and made him Governour of the same City, and modelled the whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment. And to prevent populous meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Officers about <hi>London</hi> (where they might be agitated into Discontents and Confederacy against the present Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority),
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:55301:152"/> he strictly injoined their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent repair to their several Charges, and there abide in their Quarters, and to keep their Soldiers in due obedience; and to seize all Agitators, or other Turbulent persons, that should endeavour to debauch the Soldiers out of their obedience. These sort of men wanted neither Will nor Art for these practises, and there was fuel enough amongst the discontented spirits of the Army. But we must give God the glory, who charmed and quieted these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiaries at this time, who would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise have kindled a new Flame: yet he that thinks 'tis Robbery against God, to attribute to such as he makes his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in a great Work, is a weak Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; for God commands us <hi>to give honour to whom honour is due:</hi> and as weak a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher; for to assign the Second Causes, does not derogate from the glory of the First, by whose Virtue they work.</p>
            <p>Colonel <hi>Overton</hi> (who liked not the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral's proceedings at <hi>London,</hi> and being garrison'd in <hi>Hull,</hi> a strong place, and assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his own Regiment) now began to send about Papers seditious and seducing, to the several Regiments that quartered near him; but by the diligence of Col. <hi>Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax, Bethell,</hi> and <hi>Smithson,</hi> they were sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed; and the General being desirous
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:55301:152"/> to have this place out of his hands, sent down Colonel <hi>Allured</hi> and Major <hi>Smith</hi> to deal with him and his Officers, and by all means to perswade him to obedience; and the General by his Letter desired him to deliver up <hi>Hull</hi> to Col. <hi>Fairfax;</hi> which he immediately did, and began his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to <hi>London,</hi> whither he was desired by the General to come. This place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delivered, was no small content to the General's mind, it was so considerable, that had <hi>Lambert</hi> been there received after his escape, it might have given no little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the whole Nation.</p>
            <p>And having secured the North parts of the Nation, he applies himself to the West, where he finds all due obedience to his Orders, by the good conduct of Sir <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Courtney,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Clifford,</hi> now Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer of his Majesty's Houshold, Sir <hi>Jo. North,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Morris,</hi> with many others. He looks to <hi>Wales</hi> to have the Military Power in good hands; which was also set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led there: He hath an eye to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and therein he especially entrusts Sir <hi>Horace Townsend,</hi> now Lord <hi>Townsend;</hi> and particularly, he makes him Governour of <hi>Lynn-Regis;</hi> and for <hi>Yar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> he appoints Sir <hi>John Palgrave</hi> Knight and Baronet, to command the Forces there, and to have a care of the safety
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:55301:153"/> thereof. A great Captain had need of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> his Eyes, a waking and watchful soul; one neglect is sufficient to break the neck of the most goodly Project and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.</p>
            <p>The General now sent for Mr. <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Morris</hi> out of <hi>Devonshire</hi> (since Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of State), with whom he advised in his most secret Affairs, for his great Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities in History and other Learning, which the General admired in his youth. Some endeavours were used for the sitting of the House of Peers; and it being urged only for such as had always appeared for the Parliament, the General did not listen much to it, he being resolved to restore all to their Just Rights; which he could not yet do, by reason of the aversion of some Officers of the Army; and he was forced in many things to temporize. And he that interprets contradicting-necessity to be unwillingness, is but a bad Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentator of a good man's Actions; for without all doubt he is a violent Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor that will exact that which Men and Times make impossible: To duties of which nature none can be obliged.</p>
            <p>The Parliament (who had always a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie of some part of the Army) to make a balance, they publish an <hi>Act for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia,</hi> thereby to arm the whole Nation;
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:55301:153"/> and this was with great expedition di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatched, and Commissions from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of State to the several Officers in the Countrey; and especially the City-Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia was put into very sure and active hands, and much augmented by several Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Auxiliaries, and with a brave Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of Horse; who all shewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as good Soldiers as Citizens, and such as in a just quarrel did not fear the face of an Enemy.</p>
            <p>These preparations do much awaken some of the <hi>English</hi> Officers; therefore they make many applications to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, representing their jealousies and fears; which he endeavours to cure them of, by reason and perswasion; and to that end appointed several private Conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces between some Members of the House, and some Officers of the Army; where many things being debated, at last very earnestly was pressed, That three Acts of Parliament, one for Indempuity of all since the late Warrs; one for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of publike Sales; and another for Liberty of Conscience, might be passed: These were propounded by persons who were not concerned much in these matters. But the <hi>English</hi> Army being now very tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous and unquiet, did judg them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Remedies for the present Distemper.
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:55301:154"/> The Parliament declared they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for their dissolution, and could not intermeddle in these great affairs, and so this Conference concluded. These Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had learned too much experience to do the Armies Drudgeries, and put terms and disobligations upon their Prince whom they formerly had but too much offended.</p>
            <p>At this time many endeavours were u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to perswade the General to assume the Government, especially by many of those who were concerned in the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his late Majesty of Blessed Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and some others possessed of much of the publike Lands; but the General renounced all such suggestions with the greatest anger and aversion, holding it more just and safe to be an <hi>honest Subject,</hi> then a <hi>Great Ʋsurper.</hi> He had but lately seen the Pageantry of <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Greatness, who had Acted the Prince with the scorn of the whole Nation, and went out with stench and reproach. And knew Crowns are the gift of Heaven, to peculiar Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, not to be snatched and violated by Rebels and Traytors: and the English people are of that brave stomack, not to be awed long by Force and Power; but to be governed according to Law and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>
            <pb n="271" facs="tcp:55301:154"/>
            <p>Many were the meetings of disconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted persons, who now represented to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the danger of this Change, and therefore by some attempt, resolved to disappoint the Generals purposes; and Major General <hi>Lambert</hi> being in the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, they fix upon him as a person whom they chuse their Head; and hope that the noise of the Kings return, whom now the People began impatiently to expect, would divide the Army, and make all the old Souldiers revolt from General <hi>Monk,</hi> and to that end they endeavour to obtain his deliverance by escape, which was furthered by some Inferiour Officers of the Companies, quartered in the Tower: for Collonel <hi>Morley</hi> was steddy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant to follow the General. Blind sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition must not obscure evident and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant services.</p>
            <p>On the 17th. day of <hi>March</hi> the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment dissolved it self, with great satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the People, who did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg their latter end to have been better than their beginning; for they had now laid an happy foundation to his Majesties Restauration, and the Army was not sad, expecting better terms, from strangers and new-comers than from their old Masters. The unquiet and seditious are pleased with every Change, hoping it may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:55301:155"/> their ends, but too often find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves deceived in their expectations, and embrace a Cloud instead of <hi>Juno;</hi> so that wise men are content with the present times; and if all is not so well as they could wish, they turn all their Complaints into Prayers, to God Almighty, who can make times and mens manners better.</p>
            <p>At this time 'tis not to be imagined, what a weight of business lay upon the General, so that he must forfeit his credit withal, that would make him only an idle Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. That day and night was scarce suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for dispatch; yet he went through all with great ease and pleasure; Crowds of Visiters could not be kept out with the greatest Guards; every one adoring this rising Sun, and bringing with him hopes of a Command, or an Office, or by his mediation some advance to Honour, and preferment: The numbers of his Letters from all parts of the three Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and from forraign Countries were nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous; though he referred some to his Servants, yet he was advised upon for all. It was well expressed by him, to set forth a Masse of Cares and Troubles to think of the duty of a General, for now he found the Emblem of King <hi>Henry</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, a truth, a Crown in a bush of Thorns: it cost him great pains to pull
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:55301:155"/> it forth, and set it upon His Head to whom of right it belonged. They that live in the Valley of an Humble Life, take no notice of the Storms that attend Greatness. Even the Diadem it self, within its Circle, has no such pleasing-joys as Vulgars imagine: as that Ancient King that avowed it was not worth the taking up from the ground: and <hi>Henry the Fourth of England</hi> (who had a Flaw in his Title, which always makes Crowns fit uneasie) confessed the same upon his death-bed; which is no time for a Prince to dissemble.</p>
            <p>The next Parliament, or Convention, being appointed to be on the 25 of <hi>April</hi> following, in that interval the General falls closely to the business of new-modelling all the Regiments (and this was work of no small difficulty), which he did with great ease; and principally, placed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of great Estate, Courage, and Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; as, the Lord <hi>Faulconbridg,</hi> General <hi>Mountague,</hi> Colonel <hi>Rossiter,</hi> Colonel <hi>Shef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feild,</hi> and many others; all Brave and Loyal Persons, Men that understood both the Arts of Peace as well as Warr. The Council of State at the same time took special care to confirm the Militia in the hands of the most worthy Persons in the several Counties throughout all <hi>England.</hi> It was now necessary to put Swords into
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:55301:156"/> their hands that could live without the profit and pay of Mercenaries, that they might more willingly lay down their Arms than they had taken them up, which was only upon the necessity of procuring Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Safety.</p>
            <p>And to the consummating of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on's happiness, all did so agree, that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like business was never managed with such alacrity and cheerfulness; and no man thought of cost and charge, so he might be instrumental in so good a Work. We must acknowledg the good Providence of God, which did rule almost all men, as if they had been governed with one mind and heart, and directed into one way of Obedience and Duty. Nothing can so certainly evidence God's blessing or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, than such an Union; for 'tis God that maketh people to be of one mind. The several Interests and Parties that had engaged in Blood one against another, now center in an unity of desires for the restoration of Majesty; which must be only God's doing, and marvellous in our eyes.</p>
            <p>The Army being not yet well disposed, or at least under some jealousie, by reason of their pretences to the publike Lands, and other Concerns, wherein Interest (which sways all the World) was thought
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:55301:156"/> would much govern them; it was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and propounded to several who were capable of such a benefit, That they should be assured of His Majesty's Grace and Favour: And this did not a little quiet men, who had nothing to live upon but their Swords points; and Poverty is the Mother of great Discontents. But notwithstanding all discouragements, the General did rather chuse to stand upon the feet of Justice and Honesty, than flye with the wings of Popular and Military dependance.</p>
            <p>About this time Sir <hi>John Greenvill,</hi> now <hi>Earl of Bath,</hi> did apply to the General, then at St. <hi>James's;</hi> who delivered a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from His Majesty, with an invitation of his best endeavours for His Restaurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which the King did promise to himself with more than ordinary assurance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was a Gentleman, and of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Education and Principles from those with whom he had sometimes to deal withall; and that His Majesty did expect nothing from him but his best Service. The Earl of <hi>Bath</hi> did not omit any part of a Loyal and Faithful Servant to the King his Master in this Negotiation; but made Propositions so Honourable and Bountiful, and annexed such Reasons and Charms to all who had any Interest, and
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:55301:157"/> might conduce to help on this Good and Great Work, as he could not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted. But the General was wholly Resolved for the glory of the Service, without any other motive.</p>
            <p>The General, who loved to do, not talk of business; yet in this private Confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence did give him a Narrative of the great Difficulties he had met with in all this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Memor.</hi> What Sir <hi>J.</hi> repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the General.</note> which in so great a distance as he was placed, yet he took his chief aim at His Majesty's Restauration: That at present he was encompassed with Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of no small danger, and <hi>Secresie was his best security:</hi> So that though at present he did not write, yet bid him assure His Majesty, That he would dye in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, or else bring home His Majesty to His Crown, and to his Just and Royal Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance; and of this he might give the utmost assurance. Though the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge of Treason and Rebellion had blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out Loyalty almost out of the whole Nation; yet he kept a Copy in the Library of his Heart, to have it reprinted in a more fair and legible Edition. He withall told him, That no means could be more agreeable to make His Majesty most wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to all degrees and conditions of men, than to declare for an Act of Indempnity and free Pardon, and for the confirmation
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:55301:157"/> of Publike Sales; and an Act for Liberty, That none should be punished for differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences in Religion: That he must have a little time to ripen this business, before he could enter upon a matter that was oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with so many Enemies, and accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with so many Difficulties. The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral was so wary in publike Affairs, that he would do more than he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise. And he engaged Sir <hi>John Greenvil</hi> to assure his Majesty, That what had ever been in his desire, and his devotion, he praised God it was now in his power to serve His Majesty. But his last humble ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was, That His Majesty should retire out of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Dominions, to <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> or some other place under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the State of the United Provinces. Which was Counsel as just as his Intentions; for otherwise His Majesty might have been put upon some ill terms by the <hi>Spaniard</hi> for his Removal. This was a foresight that was not disliked by His Majesty. The General had a watchful and suspitious Soul in business, and never thought it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, till it was done. Jealousie is a great Captain's commendation, who can never be too wary.</p>
            <p>You cannot but imagine that Sir <hi>John Greenvill</hi> was fraught with great joy when he sailed to <hi>Flanders,</hi> and was heard
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:55301:158"/> by His Majesty with much content. His Majesty, after a little time, with much pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy retires to <hi>Bredah,</hi> there to expect the product of these good Counsels and Resolutions. And now (as formerly) the General, like the First Mover in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, sets all other Spheres a-going, which makes Musick in the bosom of the Gods; so this Loyal Captain did in his proper time awaken the Loyalty of many.</p>
            <p>The Council of State, by the General's advice, publish a Proclamation, prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Agitators from debauching the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and promising Ten pounds to any Soldiers or Officers that should apprehend any such; which was a notable means of prevention: yet the General (that no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity made secure) thought he had never provided enough against the extreamest dangers; he gave order for the drawing an Address, wherein was professed absolute and unlimited obedience to all Commands that came from his Excellency, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of State, or the succeeding Parliament; and this to be offered to all Officers of the Army, and all private Troops in the Three Nations; and such as refused, to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiered: Which was chearfully consented unto by all the <hi>Scotch</hi> Officers, and many <hi>English.</hi> These persons had so long been at large, living according to loose Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:55301:158"/> of pretended Liberty, that no bonds were thought sure enough to hold them.</p>
            <p>On the ninth day of <hi>April</hi> (the day this Address was presented to the General) Major General <hi>Lambert</hi> escapes out of the Tower, and was privately in <hi>London</hi> with several other displaced Officers, resolving upon a Design to draw the Army from their Duty and Obedience; and on that day when it was known that <hi>Lambert</hi> was esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, being <hi>Good-Friday</hi> (a good day for so good a Deed, as restoring Peace and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice to these Nations) he dispatched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Mr. <hi>Bernard Greenvill</hi> to his Majesty, with his humble Letters, acknowledging his Duty and Allegiance; and returning his most humble thanks to His Majesty for entertaining so good an opinion of him, and reposing so great and absolute a Trust in him; and assurance, That he would certainly restore His Majesty, and that with the hazzard of his life, he would do it without any previous Conditions; he being such an adorer of Majesty, that he would not endure to see it shack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with any Limitations or Exceptions whatsoever; so that he should return a Free and Absolute Monarch to his Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Kingdoms. And this was a Wisdom that none can blame but the Enemies of the whole Affair; for, Was it not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:55301:159"/> that all Favours to the people should flow from the Kings Bounty, not their bold Importunity; so that we must all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, that we hold our Lives of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's Clemency; and that our free Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Indempnity was the only Act of His Majesty's Goodness, not from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curation or suggestion of any of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: and this more fully appeared after his Return to his Crowns, when no other but He appeared for the consummating and confirming that Act, as the Basis of all our Peace and Security, as he was pleased gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously to call it. And certainly those that exclaim against that Grace of His Majesty, are none of the wisest of His Subjects; for when Crimes are grown Epidemical, the best and assured Remedy is an Universal Forgiveness. Some men quarrel this Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that stand in need of it.</p>
            <p>General <hi>Monk</hi>'s courage and fidelity was evidently demonstrated upon this occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for though we must all acknowledg he was the chief Instrument of his Majesties Return to his Kingdoms, yet God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was the great Restorer; For had <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> had any time (considering the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and affection of the English Army) he would not have wanted followers, and it might have proved a bloody, if not a hazardous Quarrel; but God disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:55301:159"/> the Counsels, and withdrew the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of these men, who wanted not spirit and inclination to make opposition; and in this juncture of Danger, the General proffers his Services to his Majesty, in the performing of which he might have found trouble enough in all human probability. To do a Service that is not accompanied with difficulty, is not worth the mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 'Tis Danger and great Hazzard, that renders Actions brave and honourable.</p>

               <hi>Lambert,</hi> after his escape, sent his Emis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries about to his old Acquaintants in the <hi>English</hi> Army, to invite them to a Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvouse (this man could neither be quiet a Conqueror, nor Conquered: but at last he found a quiet Life the best Remedy of Ambition); and without the General's care speedily to suppress them, they had gathered a great Force: but Colonel <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goldsby</hi> being dispatched with his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Horse, and Colonel <hi>Streater</hi> with his Regiment of Foot, being quartered in those parts where <hi>Lambert</hi> did appear, by their Courage and Fidelity gave a stop to his proceedings: For which they deserve to be remembred with great Honour; it being the prevention of a Bloody Warr. The General took such speedy care, and applied such proper Remedies, that this Danger vanished like the most imperfect
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:55301:160"/> of <hi>Meteors</hi> in the first appearing; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it might have portended much mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to this Kingdom, at so confused a time, when all men were gazing what would be the result of present Counsels.</p>
            <p>The General sends notice to all his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments; and commands the greatest cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diligence, and dispatches Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Howard</hi> the Earl of Carlisle, with his Regiment of Horse out of <hi>London,</hi> to march towards <hi>Warwick-shhire,</hi> to prevent the conjunction of the English Forces. In all such occasions to be speedy and quick in business is to finish it, and in no case delay is more dangerous then in Tumults and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrections; which are like an Egg soon broken in the begining, but give time till they are hatched, and they may prove a Cockatrice, that may bring your destruction: The Council of State declared <hi>Lambert</hi> and his Abettors Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, but he would not have cared what they called him, if he had not been faced with a sufficient Force to Master him; for he would soon have retorted the same accusation. If the Delinquent hath power enough, he will declare the Judg a Malefactor; and Might will call it self Right, when it doth prevail; and vulgars will easily believe that to be the justest Cause which is the victorious.</p>
            <pb n="283" facs="tcp:55301:160"/>
            <p>On Easter Eve Col. <hi>Ingodlsby</hi> and Col. <hi>Streater</hi> joyned at <hi>Northampton,</hi> where the Earl of <hi>Exeter,</hi> with about One hundred Gentlemen of the Countrey with much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution offered their service, likewise the Trayned Bands of the Town were in Arms in order to the securing of the place in case of the Absence of all the Forces; Colonel <hi>Streater</hi> resolving that night if need had been to have mounted four hundred foot of his Regiment with the Horses that came into the Town that day against the fair on Munday following, and to have bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten up <hi>Lambert</hi>'s Quarters. Nothing is so safe as speed against Dangers of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; to give them time, is to give them means and courage to conquer.</p>
            <p>On Easter day early intelligence was brought to Collonel <hi>Ingoldsby</hi> and Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Streater</hi> that <hi>Lambert</hi> was at <hi>Daventry,</hi> upon which they marched towards him, but he was gone from thence, and they hastened to meet him, which they did in plain fields; <hi>Lambert</hi> had with him some Troops of Horse about seven or eight, or pieces of Troops rather, but increased with good numbers of others that had forsaken their Colours, and some considerable Officers as Collonels <hi>Okey, Axtell, Cobbet,</hi> Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Young,</hi> Major <hi>Creed;</hi> Captains, <hi>Timothy Clare,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:55301:161"/> Grigory,</hi> and <hi>Spinage,</hi> with many other Anabaptists; insomuch, that if the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral had not kept himself in the Dark, even at this time, and only held secret intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence by the Earl of Bath with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, these men would have had more Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and many followers, so that to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with his manner of conduct is to quarrel the mercy it self, if not render us ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to God.</p>
            <p>The two parties faced one another near four hours; during which time, the two Collonels spent their time in observing the intention of the Enemy and encouraging their men; <hi>Lambert</hi> sent out several Scouts, but <hi>Ingoldsby</hi> would not suffer any of his to leave their Ranks; only he himself ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up to them, had many discourses with them. 'Tis not safe to trust Common men to hear the reasons of an Enemy, for they by jugling pretences and cunning sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry may cheat them out of Duty and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ingoldsby</hi> was not known by the Scouts, but appearing to them a private Souldier, dealt so effectually with them that twenty five Troopers with a Quarter-Master came over to him: The Collonel dismounted and disarmed them for the present, because they were unwilling to engage in his part; but afterwards restored their Horses and
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:55301:161"/> Armes to them; <hi>Lambert</hi>'s delay of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging being observed, the Horse and Foot advance against him, with great confidence, the Foot were near five hundred, two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Companies, the rest commanded men out of several Companies, most Pikes which in that Champion Countrey would well secure the body against the Horse. Many are of opinion, that notwithstanding the boasts of this present age that the Art of War is lost, and nothing could restore it to any competent security, but constituting as many Pikes as Muskets, which might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the loss of a field by the accidental rout of a wing of Horse, and not expose a Crown to the dispute of half an hour.</p>
            <p>When the two Bodies came near, just as Colonel <hi>Ingoldsby</hi> was going to charge, the Musqueteers of the Foot advanced, and did give fire, and hurt one or two, but having received strict orders not to fire till they came as near as Push of Pike, they forbore and <hi>Nelthorpes</hi> Troop came off to <hi>Ingoldsby,</hi> and <hi>Elsucore</hi> had taken ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Troop before, that had submitted: Collonel <hi>Ingoldsby</hi> told <hi>Lambert</hi> that he was his Prisoner, whereupon <hi>Creed</hi> interce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded earnestly, and desired nothing for themselves but <hi>Lamberts</hi> Liberty; <hi>Ingoldsby</hi> refused, telling him he would not be Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous to those that commanded him by
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:55301:162"/> such an ungenerous art. <hi>Lambert</hi> then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured an Escape, but <hi>Ingoldsby</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued him so close, that he came quickly up to him, and threatned to pistol him if he did not immediately yeild; <hi>Lambert</hi> desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himself his Liberty, but it could not be granted, and so submitted with the rest, except <hi>Okey, Axtell</hi> and <hi>Cleer</hi> who escaped; thus was this spark quenched, which might have very easily set the three Kingdoms in a new flame. Many Phanaticks do judg that Major General <hi>Lambert</hi> was defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in his usual Courage, otherwise he had not so tamely resigned his person prisoner: but we must attribute it to Gods good providence, who now put a period to our Troubles, and restored Peace in our Land.</p>
            <p>General <hi>Mountague</hi> now enters upon his Command of the Fleet, of which he sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with General <hi>Monck,</hi> and there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with all due Obedience, and Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their Resolutions to submit to the Determinations of the next Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which in their Terms might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed to sail with the Wind and Tide. Thus the Goodness of God, did still and quiet the rage of the Sea, and the madness of the People.</p>
            <p>The General at this time not knowing whither <hi>Lamberts</hi> Ambition, or other
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:55301:162"/> mens passion might transport them, did prepare for a March, he being always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to be never wanting in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, where Danger invited: but upon the intelligence of <hi>Lambert</hi>'s defeat, he keeps his residence still in <hi>London.</hi> On <hi>Tuesday</hi> in <hi>Easter</hi>-week, all the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia of <hi>London</hi> drew into <hi>Hide-Park,</hi> and made a brave appearance, both Train. bands and Auxiliaries, with several Troops of Horse, which were near Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thousand men, of great skill and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and such as would have chearfully engaged for the King's Restauration. The Citizens were prodigal of their Purses, as well as their Lives, in this good jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture; and thought a Bridg of Gold was fit to be built for their returning-Prince; God keep them always in that good mind.</p>
            <p>The Royal Party about <hi>London,</hi> and in many other Counties, published their several Declarations, which all conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to this purpose, That they were thankful to God for the Mercies of that publike Liberty which they did enjoy, and the hopes of greater; and that they resolved to adhere to the largest assuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of amicable agreement with all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; and that they would never put any difference betwixt such as should now
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:55301:163"/> unite with them, and those who first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the same perswasion with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and that all mention of Parties and Factions, and all Rancour and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosities, should be buried for ever. Which Declarations did further the King's Service at that time, and the keeping of them, will do the same persons that sign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no injury now, but be evidences of their Justice and Charity. Persons of so much Honour, and Loyalty must never forget an Obligation, made in a time when they were stript of all Power, and Arms, and had nothing to beget a Credit with those that they declared to, but their Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Loyalty.</p>
            <p>Upon the 25th day of <hi>April,</hi> the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament began, whereof the General was a Member in the House of Commons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chosen <hi>Burgesse</hi> for the University of <hi>Cambridg,</hi> freely upon their own motion, which he always Remembred with thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, and I believe will be remembred by his Son, the new Duke of <hi>Albemarle.</hi> But the General being also chosen Knight of the Shire for <hi>Devonshire,</hi> did return their Favour back with Thanks, being obliged to serve for his Native Countrey, but without neglect of their great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and Kindness: Wherein he did sit, not like a great Commander, but an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:55301:163"/> Subject, who did not use to controul the Orders of the House, nor impose his own sense or dictates; but submitted to their Votes, as the Oracles of the People of all <hi>England;</hi> and in many things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was concerned and obliged, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver scarce interposed an Entreaty contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their Wills and declared Pleasure. Which carriage of his was so grateful to the House of Commons, that they offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at some signal Memorial for an Eternal Remembrance of the General's Service, but that it was contradicted by some who understood the Orders of that House, and that it was best to leave a business of that nature to His Maiesty, who was known to be a Bountiful Rewarder, and a Liberal Master, and did always over-do the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Services of his Subjects, with the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Compensations; and did think it the great duty of Kings, rather to oblige all the World, than be in any debt or obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Service to any; and this did after a little time fully appear. His Humility was a great Motive, and Prophetick Virtue, that fore-shewed his Greatness: Kings are in this (as many other Instances) like Gods, who love not to encourage Pride, and the bold Challenges of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Deservers.</p>
            <p>On the 27th day of <hi>April,</hi> did arrive
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:55301:164"/> Sir <hi>John Greenvill</hi> with several Royal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatches;<note place="margin">Some Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners to be here remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred.</note> as, to the Right Honourable the House of Lords, one Letter with a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration inclosed to the Speaker of the House of Commons, with the same inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; which with the greatest joy and thankfulness that was possible, were recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and several of the Eminentest Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of their Number of each of these Orders, returned with the greatest Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments of their Duty and Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and with Presents of many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds from the Parliament and City to His Majesty,<note place="margin">Other conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred here.</note> and the two Dukes his Royal Brothers; with their earnest Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to His Majesty, To hasten over to His poor distressed Subjects, who did all lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish for His Majesty's Presence, that they might enjoy the Peace of His Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Protection of His Laws, of which to their great grief they had, by the Iniquity of some, been long deprived. These unhappy Nations had experienced so many Changes, which all contributed to its Disease; and the distempered Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours continuing, no Removes could quiet them; but, like men in a Fever, rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, and without ease, till a Royal Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an arrived; and till this time they were without an Head, and sick at the heart. Men may fancy Golden Dreams, but 'tis
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:55301:164"/> Religion and Justice that makes a Nation happy, To give God the things that are God's, and <hi>Caesar</hi> the things which are <hi>Caesar</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Bath</hi> did arrive many Weeks before the Parliament or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and lay <hi>incognito</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and held several Treaties with the General in order to the King's Service, with great secresie; and employed his best diligence with many others then in Power and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. He had full Instructions from His Majesty, with private Letters to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and all manner of Assurances of His Majesty's Royal Acceptation and sense of his Service, which were delivered some Weeks before those publike Letters to the Two Houses and the General; which he with his great Prudence so well improved, as the work of His Majesty's happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration was upon the matter concluded even before any publike Debate. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty was also graciously pleased at the same time to send him His Royal Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to Command all His Forces in the Three Nations, by the Earl of <hi>Bath;</hi> by which he acted to the day of his death.</p>
            <p>His Majesty's gracious Message to the General, to be communicated to the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, I must at large repeat, and their hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and loyal reception with the greatest
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:55301:165"/> joy imaginable. I must now leave all Reflections; for Kings are Gods, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Scripture, and their Counsels are Divine; and we must not pry into them, but reverence and adore them at the greatest distance. There are boundaries set to honest Subjects, which are fenced with Loyalty and Allegiance, which they must not pass to profane the Counsels of Princes: Curiosity in this kind hath been the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of great Sedition and Rebellion. Yet I cannot but acknowledg His Majesty's Grace and Bounty; and these were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions that did exceed the Hopes and Expectations of his poor and penitent Subjects.</p>

            <p>The King did willingly consent to the greedy desires of the worst of his subjects, even those that had raised and fomented the unnatural War against him; and if they have not what they would, let them not blame His Majestie but themselves. For to the People Assembled in Parliament he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred all this Controversie, and would chearfully have Agreed to every thing that they had in their hopes or expectation, but he was limited and restrained not to do it without consent of Parliament, his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness being such as he would have done for them above what his People would allow.</p>
            <p>After the General had communicated His Majesties Letter and Declaration to all his Officers; they received them with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est joy and admira<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="378" facs="tcp:55301:170"/> entred into blood, some ambitious and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable Wretches improved their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses to the making the divisions greater, and beyond all healing, and many of them were forced to continue their armes more for their own security, then the Justice of them, and now they gladly closed with this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed occasion to comply with their Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to their King and Countrey, and these were those so fully set forth in His Majesties Gracious Message and Declaration. They appointed an Address to be drawn and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, and presented to his Excellency General <hi>Monck,</hi> wherein they profess their Loyalty, and humbly accept of his Majesties Bounties and Graces expressed in that Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage and Declaration.</p>
            <p>With this Address and other Letters Mr. <hi>Clarges</hi> was dispatched from the General and the Council of Officers to His Majesty on the 5th. day of <hi>May,</hi> and was received with a great deal of kindness by his Majesty, who conferred upon him the honor of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and afterwards bestowed many fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bounties; His Majesty with the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Declaration sent by Sir <hi>John Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,</hi> did send a private token; His Exile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Miseries had rendred him unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable for the Present to bestow upon this well-deserving Subject any treasures of Gold or Silver, (and this was a greater bounty, as
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:55301:170"/> the Philosophers choice, that had rather have the Kings Countenance then his Coyn) and which was more, and an Argument of his great Trust and Confidence, he sent one of his Signets to dispose of to whom he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and thereby to Authorize him to choose one of his Secretaries of State, and this after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards was given by Hjs Majesty to Sir <hi>William Morice,</hi> whom the General obliged by many Favours; And after the Acquisition of a good estate, being Aged, he dismissed his Office for an equivalent consideration; And this procured by the Generals Solicitation, so that he did not unrivet but secure him: The Modesty of the General was so great, that he would not presume to meddle in a matter of so great Concern as the Election of his Majesties Servants, but especially those of so near a Trust as his Secretaries; and with this unparallel'd Modesty he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till the day of his death.</p>
            <p>On the 8th. day of <hi>May</hi> the General as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted at the Proclamation of His Majesty, which was performed with great glory and solemnity in the Cities of <hi>Westminster</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> by many of the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; and with such extraordinary joy and content of the people, that it cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, who with Praise to God and Prayers for their King, did hear this Proclamation, as if it had proceeded out of the Mouth of
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:55301:171"/> God Himself, and bin spoken from Heaven, which was no mistake, for <hi>By Him Kings reign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the midst of all this glory they could not but look with the greatest satisfaction upon their brave and honest General, who was the Instrument of their present and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture felicities. <hi>Themistocles,</hi> when all <hi>Greece</hi> in the Olympick Games cast their Eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and cried, <hi>This is he that delivered his Countrey,</hi> acknowledged himself satisfied and recompensed for all his pains; And the General thought this reward enough, even the Work it self. The Guns from the Tower were all shot off; All the streets that Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were filled with Bonefires, the Air with the sound of Ringing of Bells, and all was short of the universal joy that filled mens hearts, and the very judgments of men were changed, (so powerful are the Examples of great ones) that not an enemy to Majesty could now be found any where; but those that were supposed such avowed the greatest Loyalty, and were not the last or least in making great expressions of joy; every one will honour when they dare not oppose, and Authority armed with force and power will finde few Opponents.</p>
            <p>His Majesty was pleased to send Answer to the General, to be communicated to his Officers, of his kinde Acceptance of their professed Loyalty, and Assurances of His
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:55301:171"/> Majesties special favour, that he would take them into his particular care and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; and that he would always have an entire confidence in them, and ever acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them the great Instruments of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration, and of Peace, Happiness, and Security to all his Subjects, with many more expressions of his Grace and Goodness, which the Officers with all humility and thankfulness received, and therewith rested not only fully satisfied, but boasting and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing in their own felicity, that had the opportunity to serve such a Prince, who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed duty an Obligation, and put it upon the score of merit.</p>
            <p>All the Preparations now imaginable were making for to receive his Majesty, a a Royal Fleet was sent to attend his Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sportation, commanded by General <hi>Montague</hi> and the General, with great numbers of the Nobility and Gentry, set forth towards <hi>Dover,</hi> on the 22. day of <hi>May,</hi> there to receive the fruit of all his labours and cares, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of his Majesty, which he prized above the titles and riches that Earth could give, and thereby hath established to himself a Monument of Glory while the World shall last, and set such an Example of Loyalty and Justice, that I hope there shall never be an occasion for imitation in these Nations.</p>
            <p>The General, who always loved Order
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:55301:172"/> and good Government, and observing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible numbers that resolved to attend in this journey, ordered them to ride in distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished Troops under several Noble men, with several colours for the more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of quartering, and to prevent quarrels upon that occasion, and that they might have the better accommodation, he left his own forces and Officers at home, except some of the Chief, who could not be denied that bounty, which with so much hazard they had assisted him to obtain for the three Nations.</p>
            <p>Several great Troops of those rode under the Command of the now Duke of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Northampton,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Cleveland,</hi> the Lord <hi>Gerrard,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which I do not remember; and the Loyal Citizens under Sir <hi>John Robinson</hi> must not be forgotten.</p>
            <p>In this Journey, the General behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with an excess of Humility, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Subject received such Honours, even to a kind of Idolatry, which he wisely decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, knowing he was but a Morning-Star to usher in a rising Sun, which though it had set in Clouds, yet now would shine with the greater Splendor and Glory, and the Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness would not eclipse but much Augment his happiness. And though he was a great, yet not a blazing Star, that borrowed his
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:55301:172"/> light, not from the elementary breath of popular applause, but from Majesty it self, to whom he always was a sure, though for some time but a secret, servant; now he prepares himself with the greatest Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Prostration (that he not only seemed, but really did forget all pretences of merit) to receive his Majesty as an humble Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor would do his Pardon, knowing he needed more his Majesties Free-grace and forgiveness for his former Errours, then to boast him with his services and deserts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday</hi> the 26th. of <hi>May</hi> about one in the afternoon his <hi>Majesty</hi> landed at the Beech at <hi>Dover</hi>-Peer, with the Dukes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Gloucester,</hi> and afterwards many Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Gentlemen; The General received Him with becoming duty, but his Majesty embraced him with an affection so absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entire and vehement, as higher could not be expressed by a Prince to a subject; He embraced and kissed him. This Relator had the honour to be at the Generals back, and the third person that kissed the Hem of his Majesties Garments after he set foot in <hi>England,</hi> (give him leave to boast a little, he hath not presumed before, though he might without injury to truth in many parts of this Story.) He set himself to observe His Majesties Countenance at the first Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where he did see a mixture of other Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:55301:173"/> with joy in his Face; Certainly he had the remembrance of the cruel Pers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions both of His Father and Himself, which they had endured, besides the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of people shouting, the great Guns from the Ships in the Road and from the Castle, thundring with all the extraordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of Glory that were possible: these with a reflection of things past not many years before, might as well amaze as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce his Royal Heart. It is well observed by a great Divine, that <hi>Aaron</hi> in his Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel carried the twelve Tribes in his Breast-plate next his heart, to shew his care and affection for them, and he had the same en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven in two Onyx stones, and those set upon his shoulders to bear them in patience; and thus hath his Majesty done, even car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying this Load, which is to be admired in his Government; and the worst of Rebels must love him for his goodness.</p>
            <p>The Town of <hi>Dover</hi> had provided a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopie, and there on the Beech were the <hi>Mayor, Aldermen, and their Minister,</hi> with a large Bible, with gold Clasps embossed, which they presented, and a short Speech; The Parson would have been longer, but the General suggested that <hi>Dover</hi> was not commodious for such a resort; so he with his two Royal Brothers took Coach, and the General in the same with his Majesty, and
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:55301:173"/> hasted to <hi>Canterbury.</hi> 'Tis a bless<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d sight to see a mutual love between Prince and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; the one longing for his Return, and he as zealous to make exchanges of favour and kindness.</p>
            <p>His Majesty had then the best Fleet in the world at Sea, (for the <hi>Duth</hi> had not yet built their great Ships) and an Army at Land that did make all <hi>Europe</hi> tremble: and if his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty had not been a Prince of the greatest moderation, to be content with his own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions which God had given him, he might easily have given more then trouble to all his Neighbours. This being discoursed to one of his Servants at <hi>Dover,</hi> he assured that a moneth before his Majesty was in extreme necessities. I hope it will not offend his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty to remember the great deliverances and mercies of God to him; for it was thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness rendered <hi>David a King after Gods own heart.</hi> And the greatest Soveraign can never be too humble a Subject to the Throne of Heaven.</p>
            <p>I must confess my Pen is too dull and mean, and not florid or rhetorical enough to describe the glory of the Kings passage to <hi>London,</hi> but I must answer the obligation I I have to the truth of the History. Its one of the greatest glories the General could reap, to be the Instrument, if not the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, of this most glorious Cavalcade and
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:55301:174"/> Solemnity. Never were seen such numbers of people of all Degrees and Conditions, thronging all the Road from <hi>Dover</hi> to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> many Women and Children came many miles, and placed themselves upon hillocks in the way, and many men upon trees (like <hi>Zachaeus</hi>) to see this blessed sight, and all with the greatest joy, blessing God that they had lived to see that day of his Majesties Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration, and were ready to sing their <hi>Nunc dimittis,</hi> even willing to depart in peace now their eyes had seen the Salvation of their Countrey. I hope none will interpret this Prophaneness in the allusion, for I assure the Reader it was the frequent language of these honest and loyal souls, who expressed it with thanks to God and love to their Countrey. The Inhabitants near the Pole, where the Night endures many weeks toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when the Sun begins to appear, get up to the top of the Mountains, striving who shall have the first sight of that glorious Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary; and when they see it they deck themselves in their best apparel, and with the most loving embraces congratulate one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with this salutation, <hi>Behold the Sun.</hi> Thus did his Majesties Subjects, after so long a night of Oppression and Usurpation. Tis not possible for a People to oblige their Prince, for what can they perform but Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Yet I am persuaded it did melt his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:55301:174"/> Royal Heart into an excess of Love and Affection, to see and observe these zealous and sincere expressions of their Loyalty and Joy, for his return to his just Rights and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance. The Vulgars (like young chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that will be venturing to go before they are able, after smarting by a fall, learn to keep in their Nurses hands) did know how to prise Majesty by the miseries they endured under Usurpers.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Canterbury</hi> His Majesty began to open the Floud of his Favours to the General, and dignified him with the <hi>Honour of the Garter,</hi> having first Knighted him: the Ceremony of his Admission into that <hi>truly Royal Society</hi> was assisted by the two Royal Brothers, who put upon him the George and Garter. This was but an earnest, and as it were the First Fruits of those future bounties which His Majesty further intended. Bounties from a Prince do dispose and almost oblige him to give more.</p>
            <p>The King hasted to be at <hi>London</hi> on the 29th. <hi>of May, the day of his Birth,</hi> that he might make it the more remarkable for his glorious Return to his Kingdoms, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all the Divertisements imaginable in all places as he passed from all sorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who entertained him with all the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies of Love and Duty; many Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires flaming as he passed in his way, as if the
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:55301:175"/> Sun wanted light to guild the glories of that day, though it was almost as bright as His Majesties Felicity; the Bells ringing, and the People with the loudest Acclamations welcoming and praying for him; the young Virgins strowing the way with Herbs and Flowers, and all the gayeties that Art, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or Cost could provide; so that by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance what was most pleasing became wearisom, and one would have wished him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self out of the croud of those Contents and Ceremonious Joys. Pleasure it self, if it be not rare, but turns to customary and daily usage, loseth its relish, and degenerates into tedeous and sour Entertainment. Constant Felicity needs a Counterpoise, and (like ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some meats) soon nauseate, and are better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by a changeable Variety. Nothing in this world can be so perfect as to please at all times.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Black Heath</hi> the Army was drawn up, and there expressed th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ir dutiful Allegeance in an Humble Address, offering to sacrifice their Lives (or whatsoever could be more dear to them) for his Service against what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Opposers, and would shew their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience better in their Actions then in Words. This sight did please His Majesty very much, and he took a full view of them▪ they were as brave Troops as the World could shew, appearing to be Souldiers well
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:55301:175"/> disciplined, and seemed to be men of one age and one mind: His Majesty did like ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have them Loyal Subjects as they now protested, then (what some of them had been formerly) Violent Enemies. These men had bought wit at the hazard of their Souls, as well as by the loss of some Bloud, and now resolved Loyalty into their Nature and Principles, and (I hope) keep this resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this day.</p>
            <p>At <hi>St. Georges Fields</hi> the <hi>Lord Mayor and Aldermen</hi> had pitched a glorious Tent, and provided a sumptuous Collation, and there upon their knees did their Duties, and the Lord Mayor delivered his Sword, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it again: after a short stay His Majesty hastened to see <hi>Whitehall,</hi> being glutted with the Ceremonies of the day. Princes need their solitudes and retirements, and certainly he must be wise to a Miracle, that is never alone and always himself.</p>
            <p>All the Streets were richly adorned with Tapistry, the Conduits flowing with the richest wines, every Window filled with numbers of Spectators, and upon Scaffolds built for that purpose, and all other places of conveniency. There were ranked in good order the Trained Band Forces on the one side of the Streets, and the several Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in their Liveries on the other. From <hi>Temple Bar</hi> to <hi>Whitehall</hi> the Trained Bands of
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:55301:176"/>
               <hi>Westminster</hi> and the parts adjacent on one side, and some Companies of the Army on the other, to whom was joyned a Company of the late Kings Officers commanded by Sir <hi>John Stowell.</hi> This was one of the pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est sights that ever <hi>England</hi> beheld, to see a good Prince and an obedient People striving who should exceed in love and affection: May there never be other contention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them.</p>
            <p>The Procession was led by Major General <hi>Brown,</hi> who had a Troop of three hundred, all in Cloth of Silver Doublets; then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed twelve hundred in Velvet Coats, with Footmen and Liveries attending them in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; then another Troop led by Sir <hi>John Robinson</hi> in Buff Coats, with Sleeves of Cloth of Silver, and very rich green Scarfs: after these a Troop of one hundred and fifty, with blew Liveries laced with Silver Lace, with six Trumpeters and seven Footmen in Sea-green and Silver: then a Troop of two hundred and twenty, with thirty Footmen in in Gray and Silver Liveries, and four Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peters richly clothed: then another Troop of one hundred and five, with grey Liveries and six Trumpets; and another of seventy with five Trumpets.</p>
            <p>Then three Troops more, two of three hundred, and one of one hundred, all richly habited and bravely mounted: after these
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:55301:176"/> came two Trumpets with his Majesties Arms; the Sheriffs men in red Clokes rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laced with Silver lace, to the number of four score, with Pikes in their hands: then followed six hundred of the several Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of <hi>London</hi> on Horse back in black Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet Coats with Gold Chains, each Company having Footmen in rich Liveries attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>After these came a Kettle Drum, five Trumpets and three Streamers, and many rich red Liveries with Silver lace; af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="392" facs="tcp:55301:177"/> White colours, then the Generals Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard commanded by Sir <hi>Philip Howard,</hi> wherein beside the established number rode several Noble persons; in the first rank were such as had 100000 <hi>l. per annum</hi> of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance among them. After them five Regiments of the Army Horse, led by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Knight,</hi> and then two Troops of Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Gentlemen.</p>
            <p>Many matters of state and glory are omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this Narrative, and the Joy and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of the Citizens in the streets, of many of this great Train with Collations of Wine and other refreshments, with all the expressions of ringing of Bells and Bonfires that Evening. And thus was the General an Instrument of his Majesties Restauration in the most glorious manner that could be performed. <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> when he beheld the glorious entrance into <hi>Rome</hi> of King <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> he cries out, What will <hi>Heaven</hi> be, if <hi>Rome</hi> be so glorious upon Earth! An occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal meditation which might have well suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this 29th. <hi>day of May.</hi> For all the magnificent Triumphs that ever that proud City saw were not to be compared with this Solemnity; where there were no innocent Captives to be murthered, there was not the spoils of Provinces, the price of the Bloud and Tears of many people; but the volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and chearful Expressions of a delivered
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:55301:177"/> and rejoycing Nation, who this day witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that the guilt of former crimes was the contrivance of a wicked Faction, not the sense of the Body of the People, who were rather overawed by Force then deceived by Cunning.</p>
            <p>His Majesty being returned to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> the ancient Mansion of his Royal Ancestors, (where God long prosper and preserve him, that there never may be wanting one out of his Family to sit upon the Throne after him) the rest of the State of that day I shall omit, as not relating to the subject I treat of, who now had done his great Office, and had leisure to joy in the happiness, that God in his providence did afford him to be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument in a work which had so much Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and honour to accompany it; and I know that he accounted this Work for Wages, and did take more content therein then in all rewards.</p>
            <p>His Majesties Bounties now flowed upon the General, who had before resolved to leave himself wholly at his Majesties dispose, and not no interpose for any thing for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and his Friends; a modesty which his Relations and Servants would often quarrel with, a plead the Politicks, that though he was a great Oak, and well rooted in his Majesties Favour, yet if some few Trees were planted about him he might thrive the
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:55301:178"/> better; but he knew what a Prince he ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and feared no storm from any point of the Compass. And as he trusted his Prince for himself, so he did for all other Depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, believing that God and Kings know the fittest times to reward, and in the best man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>The King was pleased to give him a Commission under the Great Seal, for to be Captain General of all his Majesties Forces, which he enjoyed to the day of his Death with an entire Trust and Confidence.</p>
            <p>He was by Patent constituted <hi>Master of His Majesties Horse,</hi> one of the best Offices in his houshold, and <hi>Gentleman of the Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber,</hi> Places of the greatest Access and Trust; also <hi>one of His Majesties most Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Privy Council,</hi> not at large, but of the greatest intimacy and confidence, without whose presence he would resolve upon no matter of any great concern. He was at his Majesties return made <hi>one of the Commissioners of the Treasury,</hi> and after the Earl of <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amptons</hi> death (the good Lord Treasurer) he was restored to that honour, and died in the possession thereof, wherein he did the King no small service.</p>
            <p>He had a Warrant for a Commission to be <hi>Lord Lieutenant of Ireland,</hi> but he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to part with the felicity of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Presence, and humbly prayed his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:55301:178"/> to excuse him, though that Place is the greatest Character of Honour that can be placed upon a Subject, joyned with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues and power: so that he was not so greedy as his Enemies represent him; for in all these and other of his Majesties Bounties he was passive, and did rather accept out of Obedience to his Majesty, then to gratifie his own Desires and Ambition.</p>
            <p>About the beginning of <hi>July</hi> he was by Letters Patents under the Great Seal made <hi>Duke of Albemarle, Earl of Torrington, Baron Monk of Potheridge, Beauchamp, and Tees,</hi> and summoned by Writ to the House of Peers, whither all the Members of the Commons almost were pleased with great joy to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany him; and before he was removed they were resolved to have a Statue in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his Services, with other marks of their kindness; but being informed that it was not according to the Customs and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of their House to meddle in matters of that nature, they did forbear with some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingness, believing that in such an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Example of Loyalty they should not be tied to old Precedents: so that King and Subjects strove who should give him most honour. And whatsoever some hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourists in their wilde freaks imagine, 'tis impossible to root out the just remembrances of this great General out of the Affections of
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:55301:179"/> the Loyal English People, who can never forget his Services, nor forgive those who are unjustly his Enemies.</p>
            <p>The Titles of <hi>Albemarle</hi> and <hi>Beauchamp</hi> were conferred on him because he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended from <hi>Margaret,</hi> one of the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Coheirs of <hi>Richard Beauchamp,</hi> Earl of <hi>Albemarle</hi> and <hi>Warwick,</hi> who was married to the famous Warriour <hi>John Talbot</hi> Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> in those days well known in <hi>France,</hi> whose Son had onely one Daughter, married to <hi>Edward Grey</hi> Viscount <hi>Lisle,</hi> whose Daughter and Heir <hi>Elizabeth Grey</hi> was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to <hi>Arthur Plantaginet,</hi> a Natural Son to King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, who was in her right Viscount <hi>Lislle,</hi> and <hi>Frances</hi> one of the Daughters and Coheirs of the said Viscount <hi>Lisle</hi> was married to Sir <hi>Thomas Monck,</hi> great Grandfather to this <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marle,</hi> Lord General of his Majesties For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>To maintain this Princely honour, besides the Pension in the Patent, his Majesty hath settled for ever Seven thousand pounds <hi>per annum</hi> out of the Royal revenues to him and his heirs: and his Majesty never denied him any suit, where he asked with any zele and concern, not all his life; and made him Lord Lieutenant of the Counties of <hi>Devon</hi> and <hi>Middlesex,</hi> with the Burrough of <hi>Southwark</hi> and Lines of Communication, two as great
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:55301:179"/> Trusts as any were in <hi>England.</hi> All these, with many more which I remember not, with his Bounties to his Son, whom he hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into his bosom, and takes the care of a Father of him, and bestowed upon him some of the greatest Trusts and Honours that his Father enjoyed, besides the Burial of the General at his own cost with a royal and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificent State. We must needs conclude, that here was a good Servant, but the best Master in the world. And who will ever believe that Treason or Rebellion will take root in <hi>England,</hi> after such profuse rewards of Loyalty, wherein the Receiver is sooner wearied then the Giver?</p>
            <p>And who would now serve Peevish and Factious Commonwealths, to rot in prison? As <hi>Miltiades,</hi> whose Trophies made <hi>Athens</hi> Mistress of <hi>Greece:</hi> Or to fly the City for a trifling summe of Money, as <hi>Africanus</hi> the Elder, and die in the obscure Village of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternum</hi> without a Monument to lodge his Bones, by whose Valour and Conduct <hi>Rome</hi> was made Mistress of the World: Or with <hi>Themistocles</hi> to beg his bread of the King of <hi>Persia</hi> his great Enemy, by whose Puissance the <hi>Athenians</hi> had regained their City and houses to hide th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ir heads in: Or to be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in his Bed, as <hi>Africanus</hi> the Younger, who had tore up <hi>Carthage</hi> and left it in ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines, which would not long have continued
<pb facs="tcp:55301:180"/> quiet by reason of their Jealousies, without such a destruction, but have prevented it by the ruine of <hi>Rome</hi> its emulous Adversary: 'tis certain Princes and their Families may be obliged by great merits, but these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities are rendred more jealous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful. But the renowned State of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> is to be excepted (and perhaps some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) though she be a Virgin jealous of her honour, yet is a bountiful Mystriss to ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that are faithful and constant.</p>
            <p>He being made a great Peer, with what Humility did he enter into those walls of the House of Lords, as into a Sanctuary of Truth and Justice; where it is not for me to relate his Modestie and Submissions; who only sate there to watch all opportunities to do the King service, though it were joyned with the denial of himself; but I must not too much insist upon his services, lest I should reflect upon others, who were judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to propound too much their private ends, while they were obliged to serve the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and take a little better care of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Affairs. Comparisons are odious and saucie, and great Vertues need not the foil of others weakness to set them off, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly great Trusts and Obligations require the best service and care.</p>
            <p>About this time he did new-model the Army, and set the chief of the Loyal No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
<pb facs="tcp:55301:180"/> at the Head of the several Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, on purpose to dispose them for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding, which was a work for which the King and Kingdom must ever love his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, it being the product of his Counsel. I must acknowledge that Army was for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and courage as eminent as ever any: Upon whom Victory was entailed, as the <hi>Earle of Clarendon</hi> most Rhetorically sets it forth in his Speech upon his Majesties pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Act for disbanding the Army, which was an excellent Piece of Oratory, with which Art he was not unacquainted; but the Souldiers called it their Funeral Sermon, it being a Preface to their reducing, which could not be very welcom to men that had nothing else to subsist upon, but the liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of their Pay and Military Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: yet no honest man can repine (though some of us lost great Incomes, and this Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor not the least; and what they had enjoyed but a little while, I mean from the Generals declaring in <hi>Scotland</hi> against the <hi>English</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.) For this great and unruly <hi>Animal</hi> would have eaten up the Nation, it being like the <hi>Grand Seigniors</hi> horse, where his foot trod no grass would grow; for it was a Beast that overstock'd this Nation, and it might have endangered the Liberty and Property of the people, as it had before the Being and Prerogatives of the Monarchy. So that there
<pb facs="tcp:55301:181"/> is no true <hi>Englishman,</hi> but must with all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility return thanks to his Majesty, for suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering himself to be content to part with that Army which he might easily have wrought to what purposes he pleased. If any man should be so little a Lover of his Countrey, as to have wished the standing of that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, he deserves to be banished out of it; as that Goffin-maker in <hi>Athens,</hi> who wished for good trading: and in truth they are not fit to live in a Kingdom or Commonwealth, who would subsist by the ruine of it.</p>
            <p>The Ancients did use to celebrate their <hi>Hero's,</hi> that had done any great service for their Countrey, with an everlasting remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of their memory. And this may be justly suspected to be the Original of the Heathen Polutheism, or Multiplicity of Gods, which began in civil Honours, and soon degenerated into gross Idolatries. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly General <hi>Monk,</hi> for freeing his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey from this <hi>Hydra</hi> of the Army, which was such an untamed Beast that would go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern all, and be governed by none, may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly require a civil remembrance from his greatest Enemies as well as his best Friends. But those that received the benefit ought not to require it with envy and injuries: the Body of the People feel it in their Purses.</p>
            <p>He did it not out of jealousie of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, (for all their Enmity did rise upon Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding)
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:55301:181"/> but of a true love and care of the King and Countrey, which were more dear to him then all other Obligations to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar persons whatsoever, he could have wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them all otherwise well provided for, but he could not help, when such numbers of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners that had served and suffered for the King and his Family, were under crying wants and necessities: and it was not possible for three impoverished Nations to relieve so many pretenders to Merit and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>But God be thanked, though there were so many thousands disbanded in the three Nations, they made good the Earl of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendons</hi> commendations; for they turned good Citizens, and good Husbandmen, and I believe n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne came to an evil end; which shews what an excellent thing it is, to be bred under a good and vertuous discipline; Vertue as well as 'Vice is not easily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned.</p>
            <p>Many thought that the General would not willingly part with his <hi>cold Streamers</hi> that stood so steddy in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and marched up with him to <hi>London,</hi> by whose assistance he became Mastet of the <hi>English</hi> Forces. He would chearfully have done them a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness but could not, being of the Judgment, that the Nation its self by its own Loyalty, could preserve the Kings and its own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest;
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:55301:182"/> which opinion of his was confuted by <hi>Venner,</hi> and some thirty <hi>Fifth-Monarchy</hi> men; and then his own Regiment of Foot, with one other new raised by His Majestie, were established the Kings Guards; besides his Guards of Horse, for some of the rest he made provision in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and was not obliged to 30 in the whole for their services; but they to him for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing of their Commands, and they were were fully paid their Arrears, with a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Bounty from the King, and an Act of Parliament, enabling Souldiers of the Army to exercise Trades in any City or Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Certificates of their Loyalty, and that they were Instruments of His Majesties Restauration, with indemnity from all their former sins and Rebellion. Which demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, that he was not altogether so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful as the Factious charge him to be, for he could not without the greatest Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage and jealousie continue any part of his Forces, but what the King specially com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, lest some (for he had then Enemies) should have traduced him for keeping them as Guards for himself against the King: and he was resolved (whatever Bounties the King had heaped upon him) to be nothing or any thing, as he pleased; having wholly resolved his fortune into His Majesties Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and to know no rules of his own Actions
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:55301:182"/> in publick Affairs, but what his Majesty should dictate unto him. Modesty did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hurt great men; the poor may suffer by a vertue, which is neither Courtly, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was thriving or in good fashion. Some did think that he was not so absolute a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, because he was not Mercurial and Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastick, but he was of a graver and solider temper, inclining to the severe habit of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Prudence, and knew how he stood in the eye of some great mens Envie, who more grutched at his grrat merits then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: he knew he was a man under com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and had others under his, and wisely performed to his Superiors what he exacted from his Inferiours, and did not impose any Councels upon his Majestie, but studied his Will and Pleasure, and thereto always sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his Judgment. In some things he did wish he had had more credit with some about the King; for he found Court-friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, as it will ever be, but superficial, though he never wanted any with His most Excellent Majestie: For who hath ever read of such favour and entire confidence, as he continued in with His Majesty to the day of his death, considering him in the incapacity he stood in before his Majesties Return. Which was a reputed enemie, though against all contradiction he may be asserted a Loyal Subject. The Duke of <hi>Maine</hi> was recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:55301:183"/> to <hi>Henry the Fourth</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who was justly called Great, and very generous in this particular as well as other, that he could pardon his enemies, and then love them; which is a B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>am impressed upon Kings from the Divine Majestie; but General <hi>Monk</hi> was not in the same case with him; the <hi>Duke de Maine</hi> had been well beaten in the Field by the King, who had at that time a vctorious Army, and wanted nothing but <hi>Par s</hi> to have made <hi>France</hi> all Protestant: but our General had never been the Kings Opponent, but unhappily engaged in service with usurped Powers, after they had in a great measure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished themselves beyond his controul, yet never against His Majesties Person, or most special and immediate Authority: and further, he never did bring the King to his termes and Religion as the <hi>Duke de Maine</hi> did, but brought the three Nations, and all the Armies therein to the King; which he accounted Duty not merit; and never was heard by any man so much as to mention it, with any glory to himself; but with Thanks to God for the ability and opportunity that he received from him to do so good a work. He was not unacquainted, that the Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of a benefit doth not please the mind of him that doth receive it; not forgetting the resolution of him that by a friend was secured in the <hi>Triumvirate</hi> Proscription, but
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:55301:183"/> was so wearied with the Exprobation, that his usual Salutation to his Protector was, <hi>Give me up to</hi> Caesar. Our General did not Arrogate to himself, nor reproach those he served. Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the sixth, did upon some occasion procure an Inscription, that <hi>Utrecht</hi> planted him, <hi>Lovain</hi> watered him, but <hi>Caesar</hi> gave the increase; it was not unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianly underwritten by a Passenger; <hi>Here was no room for God to do any thing.</hi> This victorious Captain laid down all his triumphs and Glories at the throne of the Lamb, and his sword in the Temple of God as <hi>Gideon,</hi> and used to sing with <hi>David, Not unto us, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, O Lord, but unto thy Name be all the glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many things I omit in this great Subjects life, (worthy Roman,) because it grows too voluminous; and I would not raise envie after he is in his Grave; for his merits are so frequent, that I cannot mention any part of his History, which will not turn into a Panegyrick, and make the World believe, that I who always conversed with him in his life, with liberty and freedom, am now turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Flatterer to his Herse; but let them know, 'tis without all ends, but out of my love to truth, to which I am bound by my profession to bear witness, though it may be against mine interest and profit; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to commend the dead, must be love to
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:55301:184"/> justice, not hopes of advantage.</p>
            <p>He did apply himself with all diligence to his Majesties business in Council, and in any other Affairs wherein he was obliged by the Kings Order, for he never loved to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude upon others, who were intrusted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out himself, and to them that he was joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with in equal Authority; he never as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed any power so much as to make any opposition, but humbly yielded himself to their Judgments, unless they did run Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to His Majesties service; wherein he was always a valiant Champion.</p>
            <p>For the mannagery of his Offices all that knew him can testifie, that he was as fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal in His Majesties expences, as if they had been his own; and his under-Officers did judge that he was rather rigid, upon the account of the Liberty that others took that served his Majestie; and that they were prevented in their allowed rights and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, which he carefully avoided, that he might fet no Example of any Errours in the Houshold; he never importuned the King for Grants or Benefits for his kindred or servants, but taught them the modestie that he had learned himself; That Suitors are troublesome Guests both in Court and Countrey: yet they could have wished that he could have been as couragious in the Court as the Camp, in asking for his friends
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:55301:184"/> what others run away withal, with great ease; At Court the greatest Beggars are the richest men; and at the Restauration it was a thriving Profession; it is observed of the Eagle, it never makes noise when it is hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry; Great spirits never are whining and sneaking after prey or profit.</p>
            <p>The more his Majestie knew him, the more he loved and trusted him; and I have heard Mr. Secretary <hi>Nicholas</hi> who was a grave and prudent Gentleman, and had served two Kings in that most honourable Employment and Trust, assert, That if the General had not been an Instrument in the Kings Restau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, yet he deserved all the Bounties His Majesty had bestowed upon him, for his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices after the Kings return; and this was the Opinion of an experienced Privie Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor for many years. A Secretary of State can well judge of mens merits.</p>
            <p>At the latter end of the year 1661. he fell into a very grievous sickness, which did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for a long time, so that he himself was used to say, that he was never well cured of that distemper; it did leave his body in a very ill habit; for always after he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to that <hi>Asthma,</hi> and those swellings which were the cause of his death, this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease did in some measure abate the Faculties and vigour of his minde, he becoming after more drowsie and lethargical: It was at
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:55301:185"/> first a violent putrid Fever, which held him at times very senseless for many months, and at last it turned to a Tertian, under which he languished a long time: some men that were Hupercriticks, censured it as a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from God, because he did take no care of the people of God, as they phrased it. But God doth not chastise his servants for their conscionable performance of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; for he being upon no sinful extremes of either letting the Remnant of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to govern for ever, or to usurp the Power himself; he chose the way of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and Conscience, and restored his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty; and how in all this did he injure the People of God? but humbly recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to the care of their own Sovereign, but I rather judge this sickness was inflicted as an Allay to his great Prosperities; and to teach him in the height of all his Glories and Felicities, Humility and Dependence upon God, which is not an easie lesson in a great condition; therefore the Scripture when it hath placed Kings upon the highcst Thrones, and stiled them Gods, presently shews them their Grave, and that they shall be meat for wormes, and die like other men; 'tis hard to be very good and great; we should pity such, for their temptations are prevalent; and if we were in their case, perhaps we should exceed them in vanity.
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:55301:185"/> When God sets forth some eminent Person, he doth not do his work in colours, but by the Art of Cutting and Embroidery; he first mangles and cuts in pieces by great afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and then makes them into most Heavenly and Angelick forms; with such curious Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery God adorns Heaven, and with such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments he does execute his gracious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses upon earth for the good of his Church. This sickness was also a great mercy to the General, as an Argument of Gods love; for there is not a greater mark of divine disfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour then an uninterrupted prosperity in this life; it did also give a relish to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness and joys that God had bestowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; for to be always and in all things prosperous, is to be never so; and such a state is a forerunner of certain ruine, (as <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licrates</hi> found) the Northwind is more healthful, though the South more pleasant, and we all find it experimentally, that it is good for us to be afflicted.</p>
            <p>I have heard some say, that the General wanted the sence of tasting, that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he did eat or drink, whether it were sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorie or unsavorie, it had the same <hi>Gusto;</hi> and I have very good grounds to believe this; but I am sure never man relished such a Fortune as he enjoyed with so little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern; he had no taste of it, he used it as if he despised it, and had not either needed or
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:55301:186"/> never desired it. No man needs more then he useth.</p>
            <p>By Gods Blessing and the use of good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, applied by that worthy Gentleman Sir <hi>Alexander Fraser,</hi> his Majesties first and principal Physician, (who at all times ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed a special care for the Generals health, not only as a Physician but a friend) after a long languishing he was recovered; he had not yet learned to despise means and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, which he afterwards did, to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celerating of his own dissolution and death, as some judge, and as you shall hear after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>After his Recovery the <hi>Dutch</hi> War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, of which some did report him chief Counsellor, but they are mistaken, for he scarce declared himself in it, till the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had voted to adhere with Lives and Fortunes, and then it concerned him for his Masters service, to spirit and encourage the work; but if he had been the Author of that Councel, it may be justified by all the rules of good Policie, as the state of things and times then were, and was owned by the Parliament, which is the Oracle of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but see how circumstances alter the natures of Affairs, some wise men do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm; now there is nothing can conserve the Peace of <hi>Europe,</hi> but a strict confederacy and alliance between these Nations.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:55301:186"/>
            <p>In this War he did his part, I wish that all others had done the like; but in this Affair I must not run upon the Cannons mouth, and therefore with a short Narrative of his Actions, I shall leave it to the liberty of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture times.</p>
            <p>That was no immortal Councel (though Politick enough) of an Ancient; to warn us not to follow truth too near the heels thereof, lest it strike out our Teeth; so that it was never judged prudent to write of present times; but I conceive this is not charity to Posterity, to whom we should bequeath truth and not fables; and in the business of History we should not be so scrupulous when Actions and matter of Fact is to be related; an <hi>Index expurgatorius</hi> is not so necessary, and the Guardians of the Press; as they are to provide for publick safety, so they must not take away freedom and truth, nor enforce a mixture of vanity and flattery; which often calls the rest in question.</p>
            <p>For the truth of the Relation of Civil Actions, no man that is wise would turn a Martyr, to sacrifice to Humour, his Safety and Fortunes; so that no Historian, being upon his Oath, (according to our English forme) of the whole truth, and nothing but the truth; which latter clause, if he keeps, he loseth not the reputation of honest and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciencious;
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:55301:187"/> and so far as to assert the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of all matters of Fact; this Relator dares bid defiance to all Contradictors, for the whole truth he could not be acquainted withal, though he believes very little did escape his Intelligence in those times; but for his conjectures and observations he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds only as credible, or at least pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable; and thinks the renowned Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician <hi>Machiavel</hi> never so out of his Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, as his Observations upon <hi>Livie,</hi> which is the most commendable Piece of his Works; where he builds Aphorisms upon contingent Actions, and draws Rules of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie from very uncertain premisses; its ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie to be concluded the world alters Humors as well as Fashions; what <hi>Junius Brutus</hi> did with ease in persecuting <hi>Tarquinius</hi> out of his Throne, though with injustice enough, yet <hi>Marcus Brutus</hi> striving to keep his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey free, according to Conscience, and his bounden duty against Usurpers, who had no other title but the point of their swords mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried in the Action, though he wanted nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courage nor conduct; a brave Person that buried in his own Grave all that was <hi>Roman;</hi> and had he not dabled in <hi>Caesars</hi> blood, certainly he had improved humane Nature to the highest degree of Moral Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of any Person ever in the World. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians, like Merchant-Adventurers, many
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:55301:187"/> times, miscarry in their projects; Politick aims are conjectural, not demonstrative, they stand in need of many things and causes, which are casual; and of many mens minds which are changeable; and of many occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions which are accidental.</p>
            <p>A while after the commencement of the <hi>Dutch</hi> War, as if God Almighty had decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red against it from the beginning; he was pleased to send a grievous pestilence upon the City of <hi>London,</hi> and parts adjacent: A Judgment so great and grievous, that this Relator, who was resident with the General at the <hi>Cockpit</hi> all the time, cannot write of it without terrour and trembling; we must needs allow the punishment was but due and just, and less then we had deserved.</p>
            <p>For after God had restored his Majestie to his people, and them to right reason; and all of us to Laws, Justice, and all that might make us happy, in stead of thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ss to God, we fall to quarrel with the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and continued our contentions about trifles, and valued our own passions and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations above the safety of King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; and as these divisions have brought many Judgments upon us; I pray God, that these courses do not bring upon us a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Judgment, even our utter ruine; but I hope that God by the wisdom of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, will ptevent it. The Naturalist doth
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:55301:188"/> insorm us that hedge-Hogs having been abroad to provide their store, and returning home laden with Nuts and Fruit; if the least Filbert falls but off, they will in a pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish humour fling down all the rest, and beat the ground for very anger; have we not many among us, that if every Ceremony be not agreeable to their Model, and invention, throw off all emploiment in the Church, and give too great occasion to introduce a new Civil War in their own Countrey, which certainly will usher in a total destruction: Upon any great Prodigies in the Roman Commonwealth, the <hi>Augurs</hi> did foretel ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and judgments unless the wrath of the Gods were appeased; but assuredly, our God is merciful, and would be easily recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to us, if we could be reconciled, and agree with one another.</p>
            <p>The Pestilence in 1665. was a judgement sore upon the great City of <hi>London,</hi> and its suburbs; Death (as it were) rode triumphant thorough every street, as if it would have given no quarter to any of mankind, and ravaged as if it would have swallowed all mortality; It was a grievous sight to see in that great Emporie, nothing vendible or merchantable but Coffins; All that were able or had any friends in any corner of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (almost) fled from this wrathful indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <pb n="415" facs="tcp:55301:188"/>
            <p>You should see no faces but such as were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with terrors and horrors, many walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the streets with their sores running, and many dropping down dead at your vety feet, while discoursing with them; All the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick in the night was the sad sound <hi>(Bring out your dead)</hi> which, like dung, were thrown out into a Cart, and tumbled into a Pit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out numbring,</p>
            <p>The day was always summoning to our Grave with Knells and tolling of Bells; and if we looked abroad, there was nothing but Cries out of Houses to pray for them; It was their last request, every House marked with a <hi>Lord, have mercy on us!</hi> I cannot write this without tears, much less could I see it (as I did all the time) without the greatest grief and horrour; seldom we did meet friends, but it was as it were the last parting in this world. The dangers of this abode in that year, in <hi>Westminster</hi> and thereabouts, did exceed the hazard of many Battels.</p>
            <p>The Numbers in the printed Bills of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, were not half the sum of those which died; as may appear by the Forces, where notwithstanding all care, the third part of them died, though they had Physicians, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, and quarters in <hi>Hide-Park;</hi> for it was impossible to finde a true account, by reason of the frequent death of Clerks and Sextons, and multitudes buried in the
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:55301:189"/> Fields; and those of different Judgments did bury their dead without any communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the Officers of the Parish: I heard some judicious persons affirm, that the week there were put into the Bills six thousand, there died above fourteen thousand; and in East-<hi>Smithfield,</hi> (this not published lest it should discourage the whole Nation;) and some of the poorer out-Parishes of the City, they died till whole streets were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solated, and death had no more spoil or prey to ravin on.</p>
            <p>I have read somewhere that when <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> (being then Christian) was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same Judgment, the People left their Houses, and all the day spent in their Churches, with Fasting and continued Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God Almighty, to remove that plague; but, be it spoken with sadness, it was not so with us under this Pestilence: for some Ministers fled from their charge, and left their people a prey to seducers; and this did not a little increase the dissenters from the Church of <hi>England.</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had their Emissaries, who were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the obligation of absolute obedience, who plied about in this miserable time to gain Proselites. And the people themselves did not see the Hand of God, nor seek righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, when Gods hand was so dreadfully lifted up against us: In one house you might
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:55301:189"/> hear them roaring under the pangs of death; in the next tipling, whoring, and belching out blasphemies against God; one house shut up with a <hi>Red Cross</hi> and <hi>Lord have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on us!</hi> the next open to all uncleanness and impiety, being senseless of the Anger of God: In the very Pesthouses such wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses committed as is not to be named: the <hi>Persians</hi> being beaten by the <hi>Grecians</hi> after their unluckie invasion, and flying over a great water being frozen, but then begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to melt; those that denied a Divinity formerly, now began to beg upon her knees, that that Ice might break till they got over safe; but the hottest judgments did not teach many of us either to pray or repent.</p>
            <p>Most Physicians, and the ablest, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, this Plague did not arise from any Infection in the Air, but by propagation from one person to another: some did judge, that the Original was an heightned and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous Pox, which advanced to the poison of this Pestilence: It began indeed in those parts of the Town where Uncleanness keeps her Courts, and <hi>Venus</hi> hath too many Altars and Votaries. I will not be too curious to search into the causes of Gods Judgments. God hath kept them secret and hidden from our reach or fathom; but we may safely conclude, that all Plagues are the children of Crimes, and it was great mercy
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:55301:190"/> to us all, that we were not consumed in that deluge of Vengeance.</p>
            <p>This Judgment, after it had done such great and dreadful execution, in the <hi>Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis</hi> and parts about; the next year it took its Circuit, and visited many great Cities and Towns in the Nation, where it did make a great carvage and slaughter, so that it may with much probability be affirmed, that in 1665. and 1666. there died above two hundred thousand persons of men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children of the pestilence, which was a Visitation beyond any formerly in this Nation; and I hope and pray that God will never send the like, and that we nor our Posterity after us may never feel such ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Judgment.</p>
            <p>We may safely conclude, that Atheism was no small cause of that Plague and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that God, (who is infinitely mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful) was forced to assert his Divinity by the effects of his wrath and indignation; Civil Authority should controul this Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. The <hi>Athaenians,</hi> though led by the blind light of Nature, (and 'tis grievous they should exceed us in Christian zeal) ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished <hi>Protagoras,</hi> and burnt his book, for but doubting a Divinity in his Preface, and declaring, that he would neither affirm nor contradict that Assertion; and would have put another Philosopher to death, for but
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:55301:190"/> writing of the Moons Eclipse, after they had received her for a Goddess, if he had not had great friends and intercessors; which should shame us, that suffer many prophane wits to abuse our Saviour Christ now more in scurrilous terms then the Jews did when they mocked and crucified him.</p>
            <p>The General might have taken the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that others did, either to have attended his Majestie, or retired to his Countrey-house; but Danger was his Element, and with the greatest Courage stood in the Gap till the Plague ceased, and took care of the publick Peace, and of the private fortunes of every Citizen (the Merchants and Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men having left all their Goods, and many of them no servants to watch them,) so that a little sedition of the poor people might have exposed all to spoil and rapine; I hope they will not soon forget such a kindness of his, who ventured his life to secure their properties.</p>
            <p>And his Charity was eminent at this time, not only out of his private purse, to which I was not privie; but also in a just distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of those vast sums that were sent from the King and Court, and all other parts of <hi>England;</hi> so that let none of those mouths be so impious, (whom he fed and nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) to belch any reproach to his Memory; I hope those that were appointed to make the
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:55301:191"/> Division of these Charities to particular Parishes, could not be so Diabolical at such a time as to purloin any part thereof, for it would certainly have brought, like <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chans</hi> wedge of gold, the Plague with it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Persons and Families; I have more charity then to think this, though I have heard some too much suspect it, but suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion is not always accompanied with justice. But we must not in this Discourse forget to make due mention of the Charity, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Care of another <hi>Noble Person,</hi> who freely chose to venture his life upon a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand occasions in this afflicted time, in the midst of the Infected, who usually almost entred Pesthouses, provided Nurses and Physicians for them that were sick, and out of his own purse expended vast sums of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, to supply the Necessities of such as were ready to perish: An honour beyond all his Gallantries and brave Exploits in <hi>Germany</hi> and elswhere: and this is the Right Honourable <hi>William Earl of Craven,</hi> whom all good men must ever love for this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick service. But before this Noble Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, I in duty bound, ought to have remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the most Reverend Father in God <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Lord Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed most time of the Plague, and with his great Charity did preserve many alive, that would have perished in their necessities in
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:55301:191"/> that afflicted time, and by his Letters to all the Bishops did procure great sums to be returned out of all parts of his Province.</p>
            <p>Many others deserve praise in the Gates, who had great and good accommodation in several places, yet scorned to quit a Charge when they were most useful and necessary: I believe God will rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>mber them in the day of Retribution, and their <hi>labour of love</hi> shall not be lost in the day of the Lord. The Souldiers that were in Town did very gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously, and not one of the Officers was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but all kept close to their General; which diligence of theirs by my Obligation to them I could not omit to mention.</p>
            <p>In this Year of 1665. <hi>His Royal Highness</hi> (to his immortal renown) did venture his Royal Person against the <hi>Dutch,</hi> for the Kings and his Countreys service, and obtained a glorious Victory. The Battel began near <hi>Harwich,</hi> and is so called, but he pursued them even to their own Coasts, and destroyed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their Ships, with their Admiral <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> and the <hi>Orange</hi> his Second, with many others, and brought away several Men of War, which were taken from the Enemy as Trophies and Witnesses of his Triumphs. When <hi>His Royal Highness</hi> went to Sea, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated his Power of Command of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty, and the Commissioners of the Navy, the Victuallers and all others at Land, to the
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:55301:192"/> General, in order to the furnishing of the Fleet; and this he did execute with the greatest diligence.</p>
            <p>Afterwards his Majesty would not permit his <hi>Royal Brother</hi> to expose himself any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to such dangers, which were ben ath so great a Prince, he most unwillingly submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to His Majesties pleasure, being desirous to have reaped more Laurels, and did judge that greatest dangers do become greatest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: but his private Opinion must give way to the publick Safety and the Kings Command. Yet it may be probably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that had <hi>His Royal Highness</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Somer, he had with much ease ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n finished the War; for another such stroke would have brought them to reason, which was all the Generous Soul of our King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired.</p>
            <p>Upon this occasion the <hi>Earl of Sandwich,</hi> the Vice Admiral of <hi>England,</hi> was appointed Admiral, and did return the Fleet home with prizes and good advantages.</p>
            <p>In all this time of the sickness the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral was loaded with business; his Majesties absence occasioned a constant correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the Lord Chancellor, and the Principal Secretaries of State. And also with the chief Commanders of the Fleet, the Offic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rs of the Ordnance, and Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners of the Navy, besides his business of
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:55301:192"/> the Army, and care of the publick Peace, there being a Rumour of a Plot at that time.</p>
            <p>Let those <hi>Virtuosi</hi> that think all wisdome consists in Aire and Discourse but consider the worth of this Noble Person, who besides all this took care of all businesses with the Justices of Peace, and Deputy-Lieutenants of <hi>Middlesex</hi> and <hi>Southwark,</hi> and with the Lord Mayor of <hi>London</hi> about supplies to the Poor, with Licenses for Ships for Sea-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Convoys, and the business of the Prize-Office, wherein he was not a little diligent for the Kings profit; and after all his care of his souldiers, as well as the people, to provide Doctors, Medicines, and Tents for them, he planted them in <hi>Hide-Park</hi> to remove them out of danger.</p>
            <p>His Secretary Sir <hi>William Clark,</hi> an honest Gentleman, wrote himself almost blinde, and all of the Generals dictating, and yet he had the Pen of a ready Writer: this gallant Person was slain at sea in the War with the <hi>Dutch</hi> in his Majesties Service, standing by the General, to the great grief of many poor Petitioners, to whom he was always charitable, and of great dispatch; besides, <hi>Matthew Lock,</hi> an old and trustie Secretarie of the <hi>Duke of Albemarle,</hi> who shared the business with him.

            </p>
            <p>Some two or three nights before the last mentioned Letter came from <hi>Oxford,</hi> there was heard a little after Midnight the beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Drum, about five or six times for a good space, an Alarm and a March in the Cockpit; This Sir <hi>William Clarke</hi> heard, who was up late, and had many dispatches
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:55301:193"/> to finish, being Post-night; and there was some jealousie of plotting, he thought the Forces in <hi>Hide-Park</hi> might have some A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm; The <hi>Duke</hi> himself was waked, and I believe did hear it, but slighted such vain ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations; his Lady did, but he perswaded it was the ratling of the doors occasioned by the winde; This Relator had not slept that night, but was newly entred into his Bed, and hearing the sound as if it had come from some part of the House, about the Little Gallery that goes to the Tennis-Court, and rose, and looked into the <hi>Park,</hi> to see if the Souldiers did take the Alarm, but there all was silence; so being up, he heard it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times as roundly and audibly, as he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard drum in his life at the Head of a Company.</p>
            <p>The same Prodigie was also in <hi>Scotland,</hi> before he declared against the <hi>English</hi> Army, and was heard by Commissary <hi>Eldred</hi> and Captain <hi>Man,</hi> two honest Gentlemen, who were at a Countrey-house called <hi>Daulphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston,</hi> not far from <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> who rose and put on their Clothes, and took the Alarm, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in an Enemies Countrey, and the next morning came to the Head-quarters at <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keith,</hi> to enquire whether any Drums did beat in the night; and being assured the contrary they went to <hi>Leith,</hi> and there further enquired, and found <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>What can we hence conclude, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the great Judgment of that Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Prelate the <hi>Bishop of Salisbury,</hi> in his Funeral Sermon for the Duke of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> that there was something Divine did accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany this great Person; and that his martial spirit was guided and assisted with a divine presence; Certainly in the business of his Majesties happy Restauration, the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God was evidently discernable, through so many Labyrinths and difficulties to conduct an handful of men to attempt an Action of such importance, and that was like to meet with so much opposition, from a thriving and victorious partie; yet to bring it to pass by such weak means, it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Kings greatest Enemies to confess, that it was the Hand of God that restored Him, and little less then a Miracle; and I believe his Majesty doth ascribe this Mercy wholly to God Almighty; for that we must acknowledge, that our Maker doth the greatest things in the world, by no means, or the weakest in outward appearance.</p>
            <p>These two great <hi>Captains</hi> and <hi>brave Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> prepared themselves for this Command,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:55301:194"/> and on St. <hi>Georges</hi> day, in <hi>April</hi> 1666. they took their leave of their Majesties and the whole Court, and imbarqued at <hi>Whitehall</hi> stairs, and so arrived at the Fleet, which was fitting with all possible expedition; and by their presence and diligence overlooking themselves the Workmen, and encouraging them, did much hasten that affair: and had not the reputation and glorious conduct of these Admirals, (who were both known to be as generous and brave as any upon earth) allured many men to the service, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Command was judged would be wan enough; the Fleet would with great difficulty have been manned that year, the Pestilence having swept away such great shoales of Seamen at <hi>Stepney,</hi> and those parts where they used to inhabit: but nothing was difficult to these spirits; so that about the middle of <hi>May</hi> the Royal Fleet was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, full of courage, great hopes; the two Generals governed with that Unity and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, as if they had been acted by one soul; and in all that service there never was the least appearance of so much as a strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness between them, which was a certain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of glory and victory.</p>
            <p>About the later end of <hi>May</hi> comes a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptory Order from <hi>London,</hi> that the <hi>Prince</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hould take twenty of the best-sailing Ships, and turn up the Chanel toward the Coast of
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:55301:195"/>
               <hi>France,</hi> to attend the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Admiral, who was supposed to be ready to give assistance to the <hi>Dutch</hi> with a great Fleet: this Order was readily obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>The General being left without the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Prince, which was as much as without himself, (for by their conversation, and that agreement for the Kings Service, they had almost become one) his Fleet was a little above fifty sail, and eighteen of those <hi>Dutch Bottoms,</hi> which had been taken in the former and this War, which were very slugs. With this Fleet he lay in the <hi>Downs,</hi> and the day after the Prince departed had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence that the <hi>Dutch</hi> were out. And in this I shall refer you to an Extract out of the Journal book of a principal Flag-officer, who did great service in this War, with no Comments of mine own, but a single Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversion after the four days Fight, which did renown the <hi>English</hi> Nation, and make it dreadful with half the Sea focre of what it was able to furnish.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>June</hi> 1. 1666. The Fleet weighed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor from the back of <hi>Gooddin Sand</hi> about 3 in the morn, (according to order to sail to the Buoy of the <hi>Gunfleet,</hi> to joyn with the <hi>Soveraign</hi> and some other Ships there not half man'd) and about 7 this morn some of our
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:55301:195"/> Scouts espied the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet to Leeward of us, the Admiral called his Flag-officers to Council; the result thereof to put the Fleet in readiness to fall into a Line, and to fight the Enemy about 80 Sail.</p>
            <p>For that the General (and the rest) thought it not convenient, safe nor honourable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the Battel, (though much inferiour in number and strength) lest it might take off the resolutions and courage the Seamen then were in, which to have fled before the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my might abated their vigour: and besides, considering how weakly the <hi>Soveraign</hi> and the rest at the <hi>Gunfleet</hi> were man'd, our Fleet flying or worsted, they (and others) would have been a prey to the Enemy. These and other reasons caus'd the General prompt to the Battel.</p>
            <p>About 2 in the Afternoon the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment began, being much wind we could not carry out our lower Teers, our Starboard Tacks on board, having the wind of the Enemy, till the Admiral was forced to tack being disabled, shattered in Rigging and Masts, which caus'd him to go off and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, and repair the same, the <hi>Royal Oak</hi> and her Division (who intended to assist the <hi>Swift-sure,</hi> whose Main Yard, &amp;c. were shot away) seeing the General in that condition, with all speed got new Top-sails to the Yards, and tacked to relieve the General,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:55301:196"/> and passing close by him he cut his Cabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and came to sail again. The Enemy by this occasion got the wind, still fighting till 9 or 10 at night, the <hi>Swift-sure</hi> and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers forc'd away to Leeward.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>R. Oak</hi> boarded one of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Vice Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals, which suppose sunk at last.</note>
               <hi>June</hi> 2. Wind variable Westerly, after our Rigging, Masts, &amp;c. much shattered was repaired in the night, the Battel began about 6 this morn, and fought the Enemy till evening, Masts, Salls, &amp;c. much torn in pieces, with the loss of many men. The Enemy this day (it was supposed) received a Supply of 16 great Ships about 2 in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, till which time it was conceived our Fleet had much the better of it, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards it came to be disputed upon equal terms.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>June</hi> 3. Wind Easterly, it was resolved by the General, &amp;c. to retreat with 16 Ships in a breadth, they to lie in the rear, and to put all the small and most disabled before them, and to make what sail they could. The Enemy pursued, but did not come to reach us with their Guns till about 4 in the evening. Some Shot they spent (to little purpose) which we slighted, our Stern-pieces outreaching their Broad-sides, made divers of them go off again. Before that time we espied about 20 sail of Ships standing toward us, which was judged (as proved) <hi>Prince Ruperts</hi> Fleet, being earnest to joyn with
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:55301:196"/> them, edging up towards them unhappily most of the Flag-ships were aground off the <hi>Gallaper Sand,</hi> all came off save the <hi>Royal Prince,</hi> who unfortunately was lost to our unspeakable grief, and fired by the Enemy. This night <hi>Prince Rupert</hi> and we joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, bearing away to the Northward, to get clear of the aforesaid Sand, by which means the Enemy got the wind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>June</hi> 4. Wind at South West and West South West, the Enemy to windward about 3 Leagues, the Generals with the Fleet made all sail towards them, and they lay with their Sails to the Masts to stay for us; which is presumed they would not have done, but for the intelligence they gained from the <hi>Royal Princes</hi> Company, of the loss of many Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and shattered condition the Fleet was in-</p>
            <p>The Battel began about 8 this Morne, and continued very fiercely; Vice-Admiral <hi>Mings,</hi> and some other ships that engaged first, it was judg'd they were so disabled, that made them bear away from the Battel, which gave the enemy no small encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet the Fight was continued by the Generals, &amp;c. with much courage, in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral forms and ways; sometimes we had the wind-part of them, some gained the wind-part of our Fleet, fighting in a ring or half-Moon, and supposed we lamed
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:55301:197"/> them most when the wind, only the wind gave us the advantage to burn five or six of their ships; some of ours were sunk, and most of our great Ships so disabled in Hulls, Masts, Yards, Rigging, want of men to ply our Guns, Powder and Shot near all spent; (Also Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> in the Royal <hi>James</hi> main Topmast shot clear away, with other damages, prevented his keeping the wind) all which it may be presumed caused a retreat about six or seven at Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by both parties; the <hi>Ruport,</hi> rear-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral of the White, her Mainmast shot clear away,<note place="margin">By <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> the <hi>Ruport</hi> was se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded till past the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="433" facs="tcp:55301:197"/> do not name; And now the General shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his great Courage and Conduct; for it is evident that there was a necessity of fighting, as it was concluded at a full C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of his Officers; but to fight so many days with such disadvantages, and before the <hi>Prince</hi> returned, to make such a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant and brave Retreat with lame and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Ships; and upon the joyning with the Prince, to return to the fight with as much alacrity and joy as if he had not made any trial of the enemie; those <hi>Cowards</hi> that cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure him are also <hi>Traitors;</hi> and to put an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity upon him, were willing to betray the honour of their Countrey to the enemy; the <hi>Dutch</hi> will confess, that Fight taught them to value Peace with <hi>England,</hi> who if well commanded (as they then were) were not to be conquered, not with four times more then their number; and the Generals enemies have found, that this Engagement which they would turn to his reproach, is one of the greatest glories of his life, next his Majesties blessed Restauration.</p>
            <p>Some peremptorily affirm, that the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral was the Author of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Warre; and to confirm it, tell a Story out of the Cabinet. That Arguments were alledged against the commencement of such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary War; our want of Allies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and Moneys at home; for which I
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:55301:198"/> am sure he cannot be blamed, who never gave an example of Prodigality; and forein Affairs was not his Province to super-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend; but when the Parliament opened the Purse of the Nation, and promised what was sufficient, the greatest Objection was answered; and when his Majestie returned, he brought home Peace to <hi>England</hi> from all his Neighbors, so that at that time we had no visible enemies; it is a vain and uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable suggestion to imagine he expected profit from the mannagery, if he must be allowed to have sown the seed of this War; (which some men will not believe) 'tis well known who reaped the Harvest; Money and Moneys-worth is a Birdlime that sticks upon mens fingers, thorough which it pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth.</p>
            <p>The General was zealous in the pursuit of this War, and did despise an enemy too much; of whose weakness he formerly had made trial: some of his friends, and such as used freedom with him, did perswade to decline a service that had much danger, and could adde little to his glory, which was established to an Immortality suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently; but these Suggestors he did renounce as Traitors to his Honour, and evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors to seduce him from obedience; and resolved himself wholly to submit to the Kings Will. Some would have advised him,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:55301:198"/> to have desired some further power, and to have been priviledged with some other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances in order to the War, but t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>is Council he would not hear of, as relishing more of the Serpent then the honest Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>The Allegation of his exceeding his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission by fighting the Enemy is incredible; but men bold and confident may affirm any thing; what was his Errand to Sea? to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and tell the number of their Flags and Fleet; surely it was to fight, burn, sink and destroy, unless part of the usual form was omitted by some Scribe on purpose; but perhaps he should not have fought in the Prince's absence; I cannot believe but that the Commission was directed jointly and severally, to both or one, or else upon the fall of one of them in a fight, which was probable enough, considering their great courage and daring, the other must have fled and lost victory with the enemy: but if the Commission was only to both while to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, then to separate them was to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Commission from both: but the Objector crieth, why did he not retreat and use delays? I know no Commissions will direct men to be Cowards, and that he had no such instructions superadded upon the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the Fleet: for he did not use, not would not suffer others to dispute the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:55301:199"/> of Superiors; it was an hard les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, to teach a man familiar with victory, to flie before an Enemie that he had often beaten; if he had come up the River, he had abandoned a great part of the Fleet, yet umanned, to spoil and ruine, as the R. Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign with many others, and therefore chose like an old <hi>English</hi> man to fight, though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst disadvantages, and unequal numbers, where if he did not reap unquestionable lawrels, yet lost no glory but in the opinion of envious and prejudiced persons.</p>
            <p>To challenge his Head (now 'tis in rest in his Grave, as forfeited by Law for want of Reason and Loyalty) is a presumption that would raise the greatest indignation; who did take care that we might sleep quietly in our own possessions; I have heard some as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, that there were Articles prepared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, but by such as were the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Delinquents, and thought like the good and great E. <hi>Straffords</hi> Enemies; to remove him, that was like to discover their corrupt dealings; but their courage failed, and knew it was but to provoke the people, by whom they were sufficiently detested.</p>
            <p>To disparage him for that which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways accounted the greatest Glory, shews out of what Forge these Engines are fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. When his Ship was upon the <hi>Galla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> and strook upon the Sands, he resolved
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:55301:199"/>
               <hi>Holland</hi> should never see it, neither should any of his Company come there. Where was here a remark but what might advance his Renown? To call that Rashness (which was the result of Council after long debates and full deliberation) is not so modest as one would expect from men of so good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and judgment; for the evil conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of returning up the River were greater then the hazards of a battel.</p>
            <p>

The Fleet was busied about fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Masts, repairing their Rigging, &amp;c. and plied towards our own Coasts, and came within five or six miles of the <hi>Gunfleet,</hi> wind at West South West, the Generals called a Council about disposing of the Ships that were disabled, the lesser Ships for <hi>Harwich,</hi> the greater for <hi>Shearness</hi> and <hi>Chatham;</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for <hi>Woolwich</hi> and <hi>Depthfoard,</hi> every Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain being charged by the Generals to use all diligence and expedition possible to get their Ships repaired; Commissioners of the Navy appointed in each place, whose extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary pains and care was used there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>

            <p n="18">18. Wind Westerly, the Generals gave Additional Instructions (concluded by the Council) that when (it should please God) we came to an Engagement with the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, we should endeavour to keep the wind of them, not to begin the battel till the Van of our Fleet should get up with theirs, and then the rest to fall in close in their Lines ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, that the Enemy (which usually and might lay in an Half Moon) should not be able to tack upon us to get the wind.</p>

Wind at North North East the Fleet weighed about 3 in the morn, the Enemy about 4 Leagues South East from us, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals and the rest made all sail, and came to engage the Enemy about 10 in the morn, fought with our Larboard Tacks on board. Sir <hi>Thomas Allen</hi> Admiral with his White

Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>Bancker</hi> was taken and fired, 60 Guns, 300 Men, another Ship of 70 Guns, 300 Men taken, and fired; the Generals gave order to keep close up to the Enemy in the night. The Generals gave particular order to the Royal Oak to keep near the Enemy, and send 2 Frigots ahead to keep out a light, and give Signals in case the Enemy should alter their course, which was observed; the Royal Oak and others next morne were not much above Musquet-shot from under <hi>Du Ruyters</hi> Lee, in the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="27">27. At 3 in the morn saw the Enemy still to windward, weighed Anchor with all speed, and plyed towards them little winde variable.

            <p n="28">28.

            <p n="30">30. Little wind at North-west▪ the Fleet weighed Anchor this morn, proved calm, could not get above 3 or 4 miles from the place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aug.</hi> 31. 1666. Wind Northerly, weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this morn about 7, and stood away South South-East; and South, about noon descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet about four leagues to Lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, bearing South, the wind East North-East; the Generals with the rest made all
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:55301:202"/> Sail towards them; the Enemy stood away for the Coast of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and our Fleet about 3 afternoon was entangled on the <hi>Gallaper Sand,</hi> forc'd divers to bear up, after which we stood after the Enemy, who about 10 at night tack'd (the wind blowing stiff Easter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) to get their advantage, and came so nigh some of our Rear, that several Guns were fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red one against the other: about midnight the Generals and the Fleet tack'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sept.</hi> 1. 1666. Wind blustering Easterly, the Generals with the Fleet bore up, and came to the other Tack, having lost sight of the Enemy, whom we supposed bore up in the night from us, and found in the morn that they were to Leeward of us, as far as we could discover near <hi>St. Johns Bay,</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Callies;</hi>) the Generals, &amp;c. pursued af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them; it was about 4 in the even before the Generals could get the Fleet together, making his Signal for his Fireships to come to him, but they being far astern, and blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stering weather, did not or could not come as required. The Admiral <hi>Du Ruyter</hi> with a Party made a Bravado, and came off a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle from the Shoar towards us: Sir <hi>Robert Holmes, Jordan,</hi> and <hi>Tiddyman,</hi> &amp;c. by the Generals Order tack'd, and stood with them; the Enemy seeing our resolution tack'd back again, and stood close into the Shoar, (where the rest of their Fleet was) in the Bay of
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:55301:203"/>
               <hi>Staples,</hi> by which time it was night, and blew very hard Easterly. Our Fleet stood off, and forc'd to tack every 2 hours for the <hi>Ripraps</hi> blowing so much wind, that many of our Ships forced to Leeward, nor could the Generals nor the chief Flags be discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the night.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The wind continued blustering, the <hi>Royal Oak, Royal Katherine, Henry, Defiance,</hi> and <hi>Ruport</hi> kept it up, with about 20 Sail more, and stood in this morn to the Bay of <hi>Staples,</hi> where all the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet were close under the Shoar at Anchor, but would not come off to us; we seeing no more of our Fleet stood off again, and soon after disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Fleet as far as we could discern to Leeward, who stood away through the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel; we bore after them, and about 7 at night the Fleet arrived to <hi>St. Hellens Road,</hi> recruiting the Fleet with Provisions what we could at <hi>Portsmouth:</hi> during our abode there the General sent Scouts to the Coast of <hi>France,</hi> to get intelligence of the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, &amp;c. but foul weather prevented their returning.</p>
            <p>About the first of <hi>September,</hi> 1666. there was a most <hi>violent fire</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> which bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned down above two thirds of that renowned City, and the richest parts thereof; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued 4 days: a Judgment so amazing and
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:55301:203"/> terrible, that it looked like the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration which we expect according to the Scriptures at the last day. Some have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that it was begun and continued by Practice, which cannot be believed by wise men; nor did I ever hear any Arguments to demonstrate it, but very weak Conjectures: for it is impossible for any to be so desperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wicked, as to project an Action so Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical and Hellish; but if any did but delight in those Flames which were so pernicious to the Glory of these Nations, and so destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to the Interests of so many particular persons, who were innocent therein; I dare warrant them Fire enough in Hell without a great Repentance.</p>
            <p>Some jealous persons have concluded it a just punishment upon that City for their Disloyalty to <hi>Charles the First that Blessed Martyr:</hi> but God doth not punish the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for the Pietie, Vertues, and the unjust Sufferings of their Parents; and doubtless as this Fire was as a very great affliction to his present Majestie, so a great blow to his Empire: for this City is the Armorie, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie, Strength, and Glory of his Kingdom: and in this publick calamity he suffered more then his subjects in regard of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, besides his grief and compassion for others, whose losses he did resent with much affection and sorrow: and there is so
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:55301:204"/> much delight that his Majestie takes in this great City, that no pleasures or divertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments can allure him from a constant resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence therein.</p>
            <p>No good man could behold those flames without tears, and the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s wish, that his Head had been a fountain of water, that if it had been possible to have endeavored therewith to quench that Fire: It looked like the burning of <hi>Sodom,</hi> which we reade of in the Book of <hi>Genesis;</hi> I hope in God there was not the guilt of <hi>Sodoms</hi> sins in this our City; yet however such sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Judgments are teaching, and do bind us all to a very sincere repentance, and to have Piety and Vertue in a greater value and to quench those flames of Lust, which we may fear justly kindled that Fire, that burnt down that great <hi>Metropolis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Bishop of Sarum</hi> in his Funeral Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon informs us, how much the people wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the General at <hi>London,</hi> he being then at Sea, and that they should believe and say, that if he had been there the City had not been burned; Vulgar people are too apt to idolize great and prosperous persons, who cannot otherwise stop God in his Judgments, then <hi>Phineas</hi>-like with a Censer in their hand, that is, by Faith and Prayer joyned with true repentance; but in all humane probability, if he had been in the City, he
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:55301:204"/> would have used such violent and necessary remedies of blowing up of Houses, that rationnlly might have given a stop to the <hi>Aetna</hi>-like Conflagration; which the other day was practised by the immediate directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his <hi>Majesty</hi> at the Fire near the <hi>Savoy,</hi> where he was present to the extinguishing thereof, by two in the morning, which was got to as great a force as that which burned down <hi>London,</hi> as this was like to have done all the <hi>Strand</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> which was prevented by this remedy, which reduces the Fire to the Ground, and restrains its spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing further; And therefore in this great City, it were but necessary that some Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of Powder were kept in some safe and honest hands to be ready upon such sad oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions; This is like the new Method of Physick, to cure hot diseases by hotter Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines.</p>
            <p>About the sixth of <hi>September</hi> his Majesty sent for the General from Sea, who returned with great speed, and was received with great grace and favour, by his Majesty and the whole Court.</p>
            <p>God be praised, we see that City rebuild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with greater glory and magnificence; and like the <hi>Phoenix</hi> (if that story be not a vulgar errour) rise out of its own ashes, and appear with youth and greater beauty, which cannot but be the joy and content
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:55301:205"/> of every true <hi>English</hi> man, and this by his Majesties Assistance and great Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, who doth afford very liberally to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the rebuilding of the Ceurches out of his publick Revenue; which with his other Vertues will make him a glorious King in Heaven as well as in Earth.</p>
            <p>The same wind that scattered the Fire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the City of <hi>London</hi> hindred the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Fleet from engaging the <hi>Dutch,</hi> which shewed that it was not the pleasure of God, that the War between two Protestant-Neighbors should be ended in Blood and Conquest, but by a just and necessary Peace which should be a ballance to <hi>Europe,</hi> and a Bulwark to the Reformed Religion in these parts of the World, which is much shaken by the wickedness of Atheists, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists and Sectaries, who delight much in these fires of contention, that thereby they may have better opportunity to promote the mischief of their designs.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1667. it was thought most advantageous to keep some light Friggots a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Scotland,</hi> and another Squadron about <hi>Plimouth,</hi> so to intercept all Trade from the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and to fortifie the passage at <hi>Shearness,</hi> to defend the Royal Navy with a strong Fort, and other means of safety: which was not a contrivance unpolitick or unground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but upon good Reasons of State. And in
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:55301:205"/> this his Majestie took great care and pains for the Nations s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>curity, but by the Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of Undertakers and Under-Officers, these designed and assured means were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: The Chain upon the River <hi>Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> made too weak, and of no defence, and the Fortifications not at all perfected: so that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet adventured into the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> and tided it up towards <hi>Chatham,</hi> the Receptacle of the Royal Navie.</p>
            <p>The General was dispatched down to make what possible preparations he could for the security of the Ships and Stores there lodged, he found things in very evil order. The principal Officers of the Yard taking more care of their own private goods, then of the publick safety; he found no Cannons mounted, no Batteries planted, no Ammunition pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pared; <hi>Upnor</hi>-Castle, a Fort for defence turned into a pleasant habitation; and all the Boats and Servants of the Navy imployed about removing their own Goods, rather then serving the great Ships: The Navie was without men or Guns, the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that were there, very mutinous and un. willing, to undertake any thing in this time of Necessity; he was not able to make much resistance, with his Cane in his hand, and three or four Foot-Companies; he stood upon the shore, and there great shot fell
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:55301:206"/> thick about him, being willing (as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) to receive one of them, as desirous not to out-live that day; to some that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded him to keep out of their great shot; he replied, that if he had feared the mouth of a Cannon, he had quitted the Profession of a Souldier long before.</p>
            <p>But though he was angry at the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of others, he would not be guilty of it himself; but in a little time made such notable provisions for defence and offence, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> grew soon wearie of such danger, and wisely retreated to places of more saf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ty, We received some damage, but (thanks be to God) nothing to what was feared: I heard the General say, there were above fifty ships at sea at that time, and ten of them had been sufficient to have defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this pass from tyde to tyde, and kept the rest that were unmanned out of all danger; but secure persons prepare rods for their own backs, and must smart for it.</p>
            <p>Soon after followed a Peace with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> agreeable to the Honour of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, and for the interest of his subject, which was concluded at <hi>Bredah</hi> by Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners from both Nations.</p>
            <p>The General had some resolutions to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of such as had been negligent in his Majesties Affairs that concerned this War with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> but knowing that such
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:55301:206"/> matters are troublesom, and of little med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling comes much ease, (as the Proverb says) he retreated from such purposes, not being unlearned to judge, that great Offendors have great Patrons, so that while he accused others, he might unjustly have been bitten himself; which is a sin that all politick Courtiers avoid, and by this time he had a little studied that qualification; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a good Christian he had been taught to forgive injuries (as was his bounden duty) but could not so easily forget them, but som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times remember and discourse them with some resentment.</p>
            <p>In the Parliament, while they sate in the latter end of 1667. he might readily have had satisfaction; but he thought it more generous to be patient under Affronts, then to execute revenge upon those that were not worthy of his displeasure. In this Session of Parliament he gave a great Demonstration of his Loyalty, not regarding any concerns, but the Kings Pleasure and Service (which becomes not me to mention) for it was his resolution to bind up all his Interests in the Kings Commands, which he so absolutely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, that no temptations could allure him to a neutrality or any indifferency; and he taught his son the present Duke of <hi>Albemarle</hi> to sing after the same Tune; which was a service that many omitted that were much
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:55301:207"/> obliged; but Duty and Thankfulness to his Prince was his constant practice: and none can justly complain or repine that he desert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not his Prince at a time when there was just reason of jealousie; and as he had learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an absolute obedience, yet was not to shelter others, who presumed much upon merits, that either were imagined, or by themselves supposed, however he did fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in his Majesties service the Precepts of Conscience and Honour, which he always maintained in all his Actions.</p>
            <p>About this time declined a great Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, who was well fixed in his Masters o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, but that all things humane are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, he did too evidently demonstrate by his own experience: In the Temple of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo</hi> they painted Honour in the likeness of a man, with a rose in his right hand, a Lilly in his left, above him a Marigold, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him Wormwood, with this Motto, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider;</hi> to teach us, that all worldly favours is withering, and ends in bitterness, without it be managed with the greatest indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and care: He that asserts the General the Author of any vicissitudes, must be a great stranger in the Court of <hi>England,</hi> that he dismissed his place there to a great friend not without advantage according to others practice; but that he either advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, or pulled any out of Favour, 'tis well
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:55301:207"/> known to the contrary, he only standing steddy, and forsaking none till they had lost Royal Favour.</p>
            <p>In the latter end of the Year 1668. he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapses into his old Dist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mpers, which being strongly habited in his body, were not easily removed; so that nothing could dispose him to any degree of Health, but a constant course of Physick, which I found to my dear expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, having a Fever at the same time when the General was first sick, and have hardly recovered in seven years, though I have applied my self to all means and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines: The General would not be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, either by Friends or Physicians to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all business, and to address himself to the care of his health in time, but put it off to the last extremity, and then retires to his house at <hi>New-Hall</hi> in <hi>Essex;</hi> where he thinks that good Air and Diet would restore him; but there his malady increased to that height as he could not lie in his bed at all, nor walk out of his Chamber but with great pain and trouble.</p>
            <p>In the time of the Generals extremity in his sickness, <hi>My Lord of Canterbury</hi> his Grace came down to <hi>New-Hall,</hi> and visited him with great kindness, and did give him much good advice, and afterwards sent him several sheets written full of godly and spiritual counsels, to prepare him for his death and
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:55301:208"/> dissolution, with many meditations proper for such sad occasions, which he thankfully accepted.</p>
            <p>At last he was over-ruled to use the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ans, and being impatient of a tedious and long way of cure, hearing of one Dr. <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> of <hi>Bristol,</hi> that did by easie and pleasant medicines cure the Dropsie, and in a short time, having Cettificates thereof; he sent for him, who in one and twenty days did take off all that load; and he began to be as active almost as ever, returned to his sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, was delighted with lying in his bed, whereas before he was not able to lie down without danger of choaking; He did this with about nineteen doses, and then prescribed a Dyet-drink of several excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent things infused in White-wine, of which the General used but two quarts: but had he continued this Dyet-drink, (I have the receipt of it) and upon occasion used the Pill, I cannot be perswaded otherwise, but he had been living at this day, though this is beyond my line.</p>
            <p>Of this Physician I shall crave leave to affirm, that he is a person honest and humble, and was a souldier under the Generals Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and so were many Students in Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, who by his Industry hath attained not only to the knowledge of a certain Cure of the Dropsey, but to a competent skill in the
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:55301:208"/> practical part of Physick, and hath excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Remedies for other diseases.</p>
            <p>In the time of his sickness I attended closely at <hi>Newhall;</hi> in such times (if ever) Chaplains are useful; for in times of Youth and Jollity such Monitors are ungrateful Guests, though I was never but welcom to him. I dealt with him according to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of my Profession about his Eternal Estate, and he gave unto me (according to my Poor Understanding) great satisfaction: his Willingness to die, he often protested he would welcom it with great content. I urging the Duty of a Christian to use all lawful ways and means of Self-preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that we are like Centinels, that must not stir from our Post without we be displaced by a Divine Authority; he would seem to desire Dissolution, whether sated with all the World could give him, or else desirous to partake of those Heavenly Joys and Pleasures that flow from the Throne of the Lamb, and are at the right hand of God for evermore, which never glut the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyer, and of which we shall never be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. I have represented to him the Favour he possessed in the Bosom of his Soveraign, and in the Hearts of all unprejudiced Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; the great Wealth that God had given him, (which is sometimes a pledge of better mercies) and the opportunity he had to do a
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:55301:209"/> great deal of good; besides he was useful, if not necessary, to the Publick: he would still answer, What should he desire to live? It was but to repeat the same vanities, and no man in <hi>England</hi> was readier to receive his Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mission into the other world; for he had all his confidence in <hi>the Grace and Free Mercy of GOD, and in the Blood and Merits of JESUS CHRIST;</hi> that his change should be for the best. (This was like his old Friend Sir <hi>John Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs,</hi> that said, <hi>He did never expect or desire in the morning to live till night.</hi>) And I hope the most Censorious will allow, that that <hi>Bloud</hi> will cleanse the greatest sinner, even though he were such as they too uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly believe.</p>
            <p>He desired but to live to see his Son well married into some Honourable and Loyal Family, that might both c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>unsel and support him; which God graciously granted to him, to his great joy and content, which did not a little comfort him that he should find such favour from Almighty God, as not to be denied in any request.</p>
            <p>I did enquire what manner of Settlement he had made of his Estate. He informed me, that his Will and a Deed of Trust he had made when he went to Sea, and that it was in the Earl of <hi>Cravens</hi> hands, that he had done it in haste, and that many things he intended further, but that Service requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:55301:209"/> his Presence, and he hoped he should recover, and make some additions.</p>
            <p>I informed him, that I had Commands from his Grace <hi>my Lord of Canterbury,</hi> to minde him of some charitable work, which would be for the glory of God, and his own comfort, and that it was my duty to put him in minde of such matters; I propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that a good part of his estate might be setled in trust; that (if Heirs male should fail) might endow some noble Hospital where the Commission-Officers that were poor that had served the King by Land or Sea might have a competent subsistence, he having been a Souldier all his time, and one whom God had blessed; He heard this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position with much attention, and assured me he would think further of it; And I do judge, that had God spared his life, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this nature might not have been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
            <p>His care for his Majesties affairs, and the Kingdoms safety, was manifest all the time of his sickness; one thing I cannot but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member with great joy. (And I assure the Reader it is no Invention) that discoursing of publick matters, as I was in his Coach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone with him; he did declare that he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not any danger to publick safety from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Enemy whatsoever; but his great fear was, the rage of sin in the Nation, and that
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:55301:210"/> such courses cost him many sad thoughts in private, which was an evidence of a sincere and conscientious Christian. And Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage like that voice from Heaven to the Tyrant <hi>Phocas,</hi> who was fortifying his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, That though he builded his walls as high as Heaven, yet if sin be within it will overthrow all; and certainly, if sin could bring destruction unto those great spirits the fallen Angels, how shall we escape under its load.</p>
            <p>These private passages I take the boldness to relate, that those who are only Righteous for their pride and censure, may see there was more of God in this Noble Person, then their discerning spirits could reach at; And I who had occasion to know him better then any, that conversed with him, for near fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years, not only as a servant but an humble friend; and I may boldly say used more freedom with him then all the world besides, but it was always for his service. I do assert, according to what I could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, that he was a just and vertuous person, and desired the happiness and glory of his Countrey.</p>
            <p>The General recovering to all our joy and content, he made what haste he could to return to Court; But when his friends were most secure of his safety, he was in the greatest danger, (this is an usual mistake
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:55301:210"/> that mankind is guilty of) he relapsed again, and took no care of himself; In the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-time he would have made use of the pills but durst not, because of the severity of the weather, so that he grew daily weaker; and about <hi>December</hi> concluded the Agreement of a Marriage, between his son and the Lady <hi>Elizabeth Cavendish,</hi> a vertuous and most Noble Lady, Daughter of the Right Honourable the <hi>Earl of Ogle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 26th. of <hi>December,</hi> being <hi>Sunday,</hi> he was very chearful, and then discoursed upon his Majesties business, in particular of the Union of the two Houses, and of a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of money for carrying on of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with several Parliament-men, and did chide some Members that they were not zealous enough for the Kings setvice. And I am confident, had he lived to see that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py fourteenth of <hi>February,</hi> when by his Majesties great wisdom those things were brought to pass; which he feared would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and many wise men despaired of, it had much revived him: But he always prayed to God, that his Majestie (whose great and Royal qualities and Abilities he admired) would trust others less, and incline to his own excellent Judgment, more to administer his great Affairs himself; which God hath given us the happiness to live to see, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with thankfulness for it.</p>

            <p>The next day being the 27th of <hi>Decemb.</hi> he appointed to be in private, to give order to his Lawyers for the settlement of his estate upon his son, and for a Jointure for his young Lady; wherein he spent the greatest part of the day; Some have reported that upon that very morning was seen a great Meteor as big as the Moon, which was seen at <hi>Chelsea</hi> by some friends of mine, it was great but low and very bright; I will not say it did usher his death, but that day his servants observed a very sensible change of his health to the worse, &amp; attended him with much care in the following week, but he was with great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty perswaded to suffer his Gentlemen to watch by turnes with him, desiring to give no trouble to any; but when they told him their sense of his danger, he often assured us that he should be well as soon as the Frost did break, which was then very rigid and severe; and was so that morning he died, and was delivered from all his pains and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, the Weather changed.</p>
            <p>I discoursed with him about his approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Death, and put him in mind of his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he related to me the great suppression of his spirits by a violent obstruction, but as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured me, that through the mercy of God he hoped he was as fit to die as others, that might make more professions then his weak condition would suffer him, some did advise
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:55301:211"/> him to recommend his Son and his old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to His Majesties favour, he said it needs not, for he was sufficiently assured of the Kings kindness to him and his.</p>
            <p>On the 30th. of <hi>December</hi> his Son was Married, and received his Lady out of the Generalls hand, the joys of this Marriage were much allayed by the approaching death of the General, who now strangely decayed, for near a month before, he had not been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to lye down, or come into a bed, and his sleeps so short and disturbed, that he had not rested one hour (all put together) in many nights: so that I wondred how his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and Memory remained so intire, which they did to the last,</p>
            <p>On <hi>Fryday</hi> night the last of <hi>December,</hi> he was very uneasie in his Chamber where he used to lodge; for though he could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure his bed, yer about ten of the clock he retired according to his custome, and would that morning before four of the Clock (his accustomed houre being about nine) in this time of his sickness, return to the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where he used to spend his time in the day, before any fire could be gotten there; the Gentlemen that then attended came and called me out of bed, and told me in what a condition the General was; I hasted to him and found his countenance much chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, but his Understanding very firm, full
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:55301:212"/> of smiles; he asked me what I had to do to be up so early; I informed him that I thought his time was not long in this world, and that I was come to pray with him, with which he was well pleased. I performed the Office appointed by the Church for the Visitation of the Sick, and he made Profession of his Faith, and of Charity to all Men; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked if he had setled his estate, he told me, in that he had formerly given me satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, he then received the Sacrament of the Lords Supper about seven of the clock, which was on New-years day the 1 of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1669.</p>
            <p>In this last week of his weakness His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi> and <hi>Royal Highness</hi> made him visits se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times, and were much affected with sorrow for his sickness, and with fear of the loss of so Loyal and useful a person; they made but short stays because they found him so observant and reverencing in his sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est condition, that they judged their presence by reason of his ceremonies and unseasonable duty, did give him some little trouble and uneasiness, and expecting some discourse of his desires, if God should remove him; but he had yet an expectation to live to do His Majesty further service, and was under a suppression of Spirit because of his mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that he was not qualified for any such proposalls.</p>
            <pb n="463" facs="tcp:55301:212"/>
            <p>After he had received the Sacrament (this was as an Alarum to all his friends to flock about him) he had such numbers of Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants as his Servants did judge troublesome, but it was beyond their power to prevent or remedy: This is the state of great men, they can neither live nor die but in a croud (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend me to a private condition, where if a man cannot live, yet he may go out of the world without a great resort or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.)</p>
            <p>On <hi>Sunday</hi> the second of <hi>January</hi> I min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him of the great Mercies of God to him through the whole series of his life; of the great glory God had bestowed upon him in raising him to such power, as the restoring of the King to His Kingdoms; and that God had blessed him and made him an Instrument under His Majesty) to keep peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness ten yeares after so great a work was done; and to this God he was directed to lift up his heart and call upon him in this time of extremity, which he thankfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged. And truly he wanted not the Prayers and Tears of his honest servants who loved and served him faithfully: And I am perswaded never Great Person was atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by men more honest or virtuous, such as esteemed their Masters Love, their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Reward.</p>
            <p>Among the many others who came to do
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:55301:213"/> their last office of kindness to the General, and to see him, almost in his Agonies, none deserves our remembrance with so much thankfulness as my Lord <hi>Arlington,</hi> who had visited him several times at <hi>Newhall,</hi> and the day before he died took his last fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well; but observing the sadness of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, he told them, that though they were like to lose their Lord, he assured them of his favour and care as much as if their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster were living and more; and this he hath most generously made good to some of them already, and I doubt not but will to the rest when they have any occasion to beg his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. The same did also the Noble Earle of <hi>Bath;</hi> who therein shewed their kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to the living as well as the dead.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Monday</hi> the third of <hi>January</hi> 1669. between eight and nine in the morning the General was delivered from all his diseases and cares, in his Chaire, with one single and small groan, he breathed forth his last breath: There was no Storm nor Tempest that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied his dissolution: he had lived a man of war, but his aims were always a just peace, and God gave him the Blessing to die in Peace. And thus forsook us this great and fortunate person, who, if he had not esteemed riches a little too much had been all Heroick, but this was a weakness contracted as King <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh from
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:55301:213"/> the straitness of his fortune, in his youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger years: this is a passion of old age which is to be mastered by reason; for a wise man should desire riches, no more then a feeble tyred horse a great load or pack.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>Monday</hi> after New-years day, though then the second of <hi>January,</hi> ten years before he began his journey into <hi>England,</hi> which was the beginning of his glories and triumphs; and through the mercy of God he now went to greater glory, God having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided better things for him, as we may in Christian charity believe and hope; and as Orators use to set forth their art in the close, that then they may leave the deepest impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, so did he in his death epitomise his whole life, for he died silently and without noi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, himself not troubled nor troubling o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>The Fanaticks did a little triumph that he dyed in his Chaire, because they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied long before that he should never dye in his B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d; but this great Person dyed as he had lived a man of business, and like a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; he might have justly used the Emblem of a <hi>German</hi> Prince, who caused to be stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped on his Coin a Burning Lamp with this Inscription, <hi>To serve others, I consume my self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was of a very comly personage, his countenance very Manly and Majestick, the whole Fabrick of his body very strong, his
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:55301:214"/> Constitution very healthful and fitted for business, before his sickness; he never was known to desire meat or drink till called to it, which was but once a day, and seldome drank but at his meal: he was of a great natural force, his eyes were a little deficient at a distance, but n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ar hand very excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly usefull, being able to the last to read the worst hand writing without Spectacles: his ears were so quick that it was dangerous to whisper in the room without you would have him privy to your discourse: his Judgment was slow but sure, he was very cogitative, and of a great natural prudence and cunning in his own affairs.</p>
            <p>He was a person of great vertues, so whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resolved to worthy Actions, that he did not lye open to the ordinary temptations of mankind; he having a t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mper so even and steddy, that he was alwayes equall to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and constant to his own rules and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions.</p>
            <p>His Courage is not questioned by any, yet some would give him too much, but these men did not discern into the spirit of this Great Captain, for no man was ever more wary, and where victory could be gotten any other way, he would never put it to the hazard, nor let the quarrel come to blood, holding those victories the most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious that are bought the cheapest; in acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:55301:214"/> he was v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ry resolute, but it was after long deliberation, so that his courage was not a flash of lightning, but a setled habit of min, that even the great st dangers did he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ghten and increase, and I think it may be asserted without derogati n to any, that he was one of the sufficientest Captaines both at Sea and Land for Courage, Conduct, and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the Arts of War, and for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of an Army that this age hath shewn; he had not the arts of Ostentation and vapour so that his hidden worth was not visible to vulgar spirits, who cannot look beyond the appearance of things; All I wish for is that when ever this King or Kingdom shall stand in need of a General, they may not want his fellow, which is rather to be wished then hoped for in respect of the special ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p>His Justice was very great, for he looked upon an Officer that oppressed his Souldiers in any manner, as a Tyrant, and a little De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and hated the sight of such under his command; he would not suffer any in his Army to shelter themselves from Law, but abandoned them to Justice, often confirming that Axiom of his, an army must not be a Sanctuary for Rogues and Cheats. He was no bearing person to head any down, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever affronts or injuries he had received from them, he had a great memory for
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:55301:215"/> wrongs done to him, and might have wished with <hi>Themistocles</hi> to have learnt that Art of forgetfulness; for none could deceive him twice. He wrested no mans Office or Lands out of his hands though he had power e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, nor robbed the King or Kingdom of thousands that he might make a purse for himself; he dyed poss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d of a good estate, but it was the Kings Bounty, and in a great measure his own Frugality, and if some had had the like advantages, I believe they would have doubled his increase, and perhaps some have not omitted their diligence, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards confounded it with Prodigality and Riot: we must allow him just, for did he not put his life in jeopardy to do that prime piece of justice of giving <hi>Caesar</hi> the things which are <hi>Caesars;</hi> and no throngs of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors ever mustered at his Gate waiting for their own rights; his affairs and business was always mannaged with the paying at the time of receiving.</p>
            <p>His temperance was remarkable (whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the black mouthed Sectaries assert, who smut all them that are not in confederacy with themselves) I have know him fast from eating and drinking above thirty hours many times upon the obligation of necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and important affairs, and constantly made but one meal a day, and in that was not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver curious, having been accustomed to the
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:55301:215"/> hardships of a Souldiers life in his younger years. He was the most watchful person that you have heard of, four hours sleep was to him sufficient and full satisfaction; <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius</hi> the Oracle of the Heathens did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell the Empire of <hi>Vespasian</hi> from his watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.</p>
            <p>He took no delight in the vanities of Pomp and State; he so abhorred the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery of drinking, that he would never preferr an Officer that was guilty of that beastliness: Towards the latter end of his life, he was for some years after a long Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver disposed to a Dropsie, which is a thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty disease, but then I have known him for many moneths never drink between meales at the time of his residence at <hi>New-hall.</hi> A lesson of Temperance that I could wish ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny would learn that censure others of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, yet spend their days in <hi>Coffee</hi>-houses and Taverns; sometimes but rarely he did remit, but it was upon extraordinary occasions, out of complacence and civility, never for his own delight or desire.</p>
            <p>Chastity was his second Nature, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing did stink in his Nostrils like unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and I believe after his marriage he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cast an amorous glance upon any other Woman; he was indeed one of the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent Husbands in the World, and as good a Father as Husband: And I think I may
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:55301:216"/> assert without reflection upon any, the best Subject to his Prince that ever the Earth bred.</p>
            <p>His Prudence was a Vertue Paramount in him and Mistress of all the rest, and this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared that after the exclusion of Majesty, and put out of the Throne for many years, he restored it without one drop of blood, and made them his instruments, who had been the excluders, and having to doe with so many various interests and factions, (all striving for the Power) he managed them so well that they were a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l serviceable to his ends, and those children of the Serpent, with all their little Policies and cunning, could never give him the Go-by, but he out-witted them all. And certainly we may conclude his Prudence exceeded his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; For to the first he owed all his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n ss, and the bravest Actions he performed; which was, restoring Maj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>stie to its proper Rights and Prerogatives, without any dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions or abatements; and perhaps, had the opportunity been well improved, higher then in the days of our Ancestors; This was Prudence indeed, which was not constituted of Eloquence or words, but a practical Dexterity to apply Actions to their proper times and seasons, wherein he was no small Craftsmaster.</p>
            <p>His Religion the censorious Schismaticks
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:55301:216"/> will question, out of whose mouths he plucked the sacred Patrimony of the Church, and therefore they will excommunicate him out of theirs, and then must he be one of the wicked: But though he did not put on a forme of Godliness to serve his passions and ends, yet he had the Power well rooted and fixed in his heart; he did not take up Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion for Ostentation, but for its own sake, those real and solid joys he found in it, were secret and hidden from the world; He was instructed well in the Mystery of God, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested in the flesh; and in the death and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Christ was all his confidence, of which he would discourse with great comfort and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance; he inclined much to the rigidest Points of Predestination, and the absolute Decrees; This some will say was a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine not disagreeable to Souldiers, who use to prove it with the common Theam, that every Bullet hath its Commission. He was observed to be very careful in the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that God requires of a Christian, as well as to claim the Priviledges of Religion: In all his Passions and great concerns where he had provocation enough, yet was never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to swear an oath, and I think none can witness the contrary. I wish the <hi>Hectors</hi> and <hi>Roaring</hi> Boys, that think they cannot speak with a good Accent, without <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me's, Blood</hi> and <hi>Wounds,</hi> would learn to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:55301:217"/> his Example, who hath taught that those <hi>Rabshakeh</hi> s whose Mouths are full of Blasphemy and Curses, are but Poltrons and Cowards.</p>
            <p>He was one that always applied himself to Prayer, and hearing Sermons on the Lords day, and where he was Master of his own time to some reading and meditation, and every day maintained Gods Worship in his Family; he was a Reverencer of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that were pious and peaceable; and always thought them fit to be his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: he was a great enemy to Sacriledge, and would never make a Purchase of that which had been once dedicated to God. A Story I have heard him tell of his own ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation (which may be a little too light to intermix with these graver matters) when a child; That there was an ancient Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel out of repair in the Mansion of <hi>Pothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge</hi> (since by him put into a good repair, when it came into his possession) and there was a Font cut out of Stone for the rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptacle of the Water for Baptism, which lying about the Yard they used to feed their Calves out of it, and still none of them thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but pined and died, till they made use of other vessels to feed them out of; what use can we make of this, but that sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious persons seldom prosper with consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted spoils; but like the flesh from the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:55301:217"/> it sets their nest on fire, and like <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chans</hi> wedge of Gold, it brings ruine with it.</p>
            <p>He was thought to be somewhat too fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, but this was the indisposition of his Age; we must separate men out of the world, when we abstract them from all weakness and infirmities.</p>
            <p>His Courage was as great in suffering as in doing; never person was loaded with such distempers, that bore them with greater Patience, never complaining of any pain, or so much as expressing the least sentiments of uneasiness. I know many that looked upon the Duke of <hi>Albemarle</hi> through Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, like People that look through co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured Glass, see all things of that colour; so they make him of what colour they please, but those that were thoroughly and inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquainted, will give testimony to this Character; he was a Person that contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himself into secrecie, and his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues lay deep, and were not visible to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Visitor.</p>
            <p>His diligence and painfulness was much admired by all that knew him, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied in business; his manner of life at <hi>Dalkeith</hi> is not to be omitted, which may be no ill example to others, who are intrusted with the managery of publick affairs; he was always an early Riser in the Morning,
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:55301:218"/> where after dressing and Closet-Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which were all finished before se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the Clock; at which time he whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly till night attended publick Affairs, being waited upon with his two Secretaries, and gave access to all, even the poorest Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as well as the greatest Lords; after dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing with them, he presently gave his Secretaries Order in it, and they were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched the very same houre. If they stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till dinner, they had heartily welcom with great freedom. And after dinner he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the same publick Offices and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, hearing all grievances and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints; as <hi>Rodulph of Habsburgh,</hi> the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancer of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> who ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiered some of his Guards for repulsing some indigent Petitioners, and telling them he was like the Sun to shine upon Dunghils, as well as Mountains, an Emperour to all; not to be locked up, and possessed by a few. Government is not state and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, but business and great labour: By this means he understood the inclinations of his whole Army, and was not ignorant of the temper of the Countrey, and every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable person in it; I have admired at his continual duty, being never tyred out when business lasted night and day; he was not too sudden in matters of great concern, but took time well to deliberate, and
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:55301:218"/> then he seldome missed his way.</p>
            <p>He loved no manner of Play, nor used any; All his pleasure was walking and conferring with a trustie Friend in a spaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous room, but if any the least business invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he applied to it: Afterwards his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians in <hi>England</hi> did advise him to play for divertisement, being inclined a little to a Lethargy after his Fever, wherein he never wagered more, then what he was indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent either to win or lose, yet he loved the victory.</p>
            <p>After he was fourty years of Age he married, and had two sons, the youngest son <hi>George</hi> died at <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> and was buried in the Chancel of that Church: never fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther took the loss of a child with more tears and grief, which would seem incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, that a man of so great an heart should yield to such sorrows, but it was certainly an evidence of a great sweetness of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and of a tender affection; his eldest son <hi>Christopher,</hi> now Duke of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> whom God long preserve, that he may both attain the vertues and years of his father.</p>
            <p>I have set his brightest side to the world, but stood too near him to assert that he was all Gold, without any mixture; It is an old maxime, That there are no metals obsolutely pure, without some dross, (unless our new
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:55301:219"/> Philosophers of the Fire can shew a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration to the contrary) I am sure, mortal man can never be so refined till death redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth him (like Chymists) to Dust and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; while we are in the present tense, we cannot arrive at the perfect tense; and as long as we live under the Moon, we partake of its influence and nature, that is, to have some spots in the midst of our vertues.</p>
            <p>After he was dead, his Majestie took care of his Embalming, and being opened, this was the Judgment that the Physicians gave of his Distemper.</p>

The Trunk of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie in the inside covered with a tartareous concretion, from its Arise from the Heart down to the Crural and Iliack divarications, not every where, but at several distances: In the Bladder nothing but Urine; and its body and figure very natural.</p>
                        <p>In the <hi>Thorax</hi> some small quantity of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter extravasated: the Lungs only repleted with blood, as they use to be in a Patient dying suddenly, and suffocated in the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack Arterie, and the great Arterie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Valves a circular Tartareous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.</p>

In the left Ventricle the same

That being concluded by them all the immediate cause of his death. The Head opened, and nothing in it found preternatural.</p>

            <p>And now I hope all envie and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice is buried with him; though I am not such an Idolater to his Memory,
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:55301:220"/> as to think of him above the bounds of a mortal man, yet certainly those who have reaped Honour and Riches by his Service, or at least are restored to that which was unjustly usurped from them, cannot but keep a good esteem, and kinde remembrance to his Name and Family, (according to His Majesties most glorious Example) without the greatest crime of Ingratitude. But what shall we say to those that have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved (by Gods Blessing upon his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors) great Advantages of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Laws, Liberties and Revenues, and yet cannot let him rest in his Grave without reproach; It was an allowed Curse of old, (we have learned better things under the Gospel, to bless and not curse) that wo might follow him that defiled a Fountain; and what ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance will overtake them that revile those that God hath made instruments of their welfare and happiness; like <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mei</hi>'s wickedness, it will bring Judgments without our Imprecations. Some have observed, that prosperous and glorious persons have had inglorious ends, which might be proved by the Induction of many particulars; But this Noble Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son died in the greatest Honour, belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of his Sovereign, and of all mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:55301:221"/> and sober Persons in these Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>Some may say, That they did not see those great Parts and Vertues as here are represented, like those that beheld <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbegs</hi> Battel-Axe, pretended to see no great matter in it, but they were told they did not see the Arm that managed it; so many despised the Generals Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie and Humility in his bodily Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and outward Appearance, though that was but despicable; but they did not behold the Mind that was stored with Courage and Prudence, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged all his Actions. If these men had seen him in a Sea-Fight, or at the Head of an Army, ready to engage like Thunder and Lightning, they would assent to this Relation; but these fights may be a little too terrible for these Censurers, who had the rather beho d Plays, Balls and fair Ladies; Against whom they understand only how to make Warres and Sieges, that may end in Embraces; yet dare deride those whose swords hath procured that peace, in which they enjoy their Courtship and Dalliance; and though he be a dead Lion, yet from him they have found sweetness.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Aethiopians</hi> make their Sepulchers of Glass, and after they have dried the Corps, they artificially paint it, and set it in a glass Coffin, that the whole frame and lineaments of the body may be discernable; This is not accounted Barbarisme in them; many and those not unwise do think that they deserve better of the dead, and more thanks from the living, who draw the lineaments of their mind, and represent their vertues and graces as in a mirrour for others imitation, though it be but with the weak and broken rayes of reflection; so that in this work the Relator hopes he hath not trespassed either against piety, justice, or charity; if he hath wanted skill or stile, he hath compensated it with a good affection, first to truth, and then to the subject. No person can be so sacred, but scurrilous wits may prophane, when they dare attempt Heaven, and make a mock of the Divinity; The great <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> who among the Christian Emperors justly deserves to go next to <hi>Constantine</hi> for all vertues, and to have an eminent place in the Holy Court, who is celebrated by all Writers for the restorer of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and by <hi>Procopius</hi> himself in his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Annals: yet this very same Author because he was not gratified in his ambition above his merits, in a secret History does make him a Tyrant, a Conjurer, yea, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:55301:222"/> Devil; and his Empress, the veryest Monster for Lust, Cruelty and Covetousness that the Earth ever bore: who can be fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by his proper vertues from Satyricall Tongues, that can calumniate valiantly and boldly, and force a belief upon humane nature, which is too credulous and partiall to accusing parties.</p>
            <p>Some wise men would have all the former part of the Generals Life without remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, judging those actions, though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Irish Rebels, and the Dutch ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to be brutish valour and baffled reason, Rhetorical Flourishes cannot alter the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and property of things. They that tax others of too much courage, I am affraid want some grains themselves. I dare not wish that the General had never engaged with and for the usurpers in those places, for then he might never have had the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to have performed the great service; but these that are so concerned for to bury in silence the first part of his life, I may believe without uncharitableness would have all his actions to be for ever forgotten; but tis left to their choice to forget what they please, and if they remember any thing that is blame worthy, Christian Religion may teach them forgiveness, and Morall virtue in requital for his other good works, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulness; There are no such bloody
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:55301:222"/> wounds as from the hands of seeming friends, nor no abuses for virulent, as from Hypocriticall commenders, who attack with bread in one hand and a stone in the other, that for one praise scatter many reproaches.</p>
            <p>Some are such friends to peace and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that they would have our General wholly to put off the martiall dress, and not be adorned with arms and blood, but in the white Robes of a Confessor: I doe know that he did true penance for errors in this kind, and the world can witness he made satisfaction, and had time and leisure to implore the precious blood of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to wash him from all blood-guiltiness. But why does not these men quarrel the Heraulds for not exposing him in State in his Parliament Robes, or in those of the most noble Order of the Garter, but cloathed him in Arms and performed the ceremony as to a great General.</p>
            <p>Every good man will chearfully joyn in hearty prayers, that the sound of war may be no more heard in our Land, no leading into captivity nor complaint in our streets, but the remembrance of former miseries may make us thankfull for present mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. If these Censors retained the same opinion in all Histories they would soon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the greatest Chronicles to the bulk and price of a Diurnall, and leave the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
